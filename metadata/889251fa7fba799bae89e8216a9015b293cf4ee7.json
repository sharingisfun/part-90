Styx, the first Goblin, wants to steal the heart of a World-Tree, enclosed inside the huge and terrifying Tower of Akenash. It is a kind of Bildungsroman that leads Styx to a better understanding of his own origins.[2]\n\nThe very first of all the Goblins, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a master in the arts of stealth, thievery, and murder. The depths of the miles-high Tower of Akenash, where Humans and Elves hide and protect the Tree, the source of the Amber, are the best chance Styx has of quickly amassing a small fortune and, perhaps, discover more about his true origins along the way.\n\n\n\n* enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:889251fa7fba799bae89e8216a9015b293cf4ee7","amp;dn":"Styx+Master+of+Shadows+DecompressedPortable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"889251fa7fba799bae89e8216a9015b293cf4ee7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,146,81,250,127,186,121,155,174,137,232,33,106,144,21,178,147,207,78,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
