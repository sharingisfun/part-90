Their sound combined heavy rock guitar courtesy of Earl Johnson, interesting lyrics and the vocal stylings of Buzz Sherman. They recorded three albums between 1976 and 1977 but were derailed when Sherman perished in a motorcycle accident. They recorded an album with future Loverboy singer Mike Reno but it wasn't the same. The last album was released in 2000 with a third vocalist leading to the live album Raw in 2002 which is quite good.
