I upload this because I like to have a portable copy on my external HD and like to be able to watch films on my phone. No watchable original-audio &lt;1GB rip was available at the time. This is essentially a re-code of HighCode's 10GB rip.\n\nIt's encoded in 1080p because that way I could get more detail out of x264 than with 720p, since this film has a lot of nature pans and stills. But due to the compression it shouldn't be called anything more than 720p, so I decided to omit the resolution from the title.\n\nFILM INFORMATION\n________________\n\nTitle: Black Sheep\nYear: 2006\nIMDb rating: 5.8\nDirector: Jonathan King\nGenre: Comedy / Horror (mostly comedy, really)\nFeaturing Nathan Meister, Peter Feeney, Danielle Mason\nDescription: An experiment in genetic engineering turns harmless sheep into blood-thirsty killers that terrorise a spralwing New Zealand farm.\n\n\nPRODUCT\n_______\n\nFormat: Blu-ray\nEdition: Theatrical Edition, 76 minutes 26 seconds\nSpoken Language: English\nSubtitle Language: English, Danish, Finnish, Hungarian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Rumanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Vietnamese\nThe English subtitles have been corrected and slightly re-synced.

The English subtitle track was edited by Subtitle Edit.\n\n\nCODECS AND CHANNELS: Screenshots\n________________________________\n\nAll screenshots are taken as snapshot from VLC (stored as PNG). They were then run through optipng to reduce the download size losslessly. They are meant as preview.\n\n\nQUALITY ASSURANCE\n_________________\n\nThe film was watched in VLC to assure its quality.\nDetail is nice when things are standing almost still. Detail is lacking in heavily moving scenes. Some macro blocking occurs in dark scenes. Audio is in sync.\n\nThe commentary track was not completely listened in the quality assurance, but skipped through and it seemed fine and synced throughout.\n\nEnglish subtitles were watched and the sync was corrected here and there. Still not perfect, but better than what usually comes with a Blu-ray. Actual text is excellent.\n\nOther subtitles were not checked or corrected.\n\nI'll be seeding this the first week 24/7, then for a few weeks in (European) evenings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3577877f6f16a00cbab04abe39ac4f591f25af17","amp;dn":"Black+Sheep+%282006%29+BluRay+h264+%5BGhost%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3577877f6f16a00cbab04abe39ac4f591f25af17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,119,135,127,111,22,160,12,186,176,74,190,57,172,79,89,31,37,175,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
