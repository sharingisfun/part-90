You could break it up into 1-2 and then 3-5 of course.\n\nMoonlight, similarly, could be broken up as movements 1-2 followed by 3 and the Appassionata sonatas as 1 followed by 2-3 together.\n\nAnyway, that's all very complicated and it's much easier to just group them by title and, if possible, glue the various movements together (by demultiplex/multiplex using avidemux as I have done here) without having to re-encode the video data (or audio) data.\n\n- user10196","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77b8cf042b7290dab8cf32c2753a0e551082e43c","amp;dn":"Beethoven.Sonatas.Valentina.Lisitsa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77b8cf042b7290dab8cf32c2753a0e551082e43c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,184,207,4,43,114,144,218,184,207,50,194,117,58,14,85,16,130,228,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
