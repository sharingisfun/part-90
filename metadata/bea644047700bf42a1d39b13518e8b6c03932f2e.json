Then, on the same day, he is condemned to death, and given a new cellmate. \nShould he kill him, or risk revealing his plans to someone who may be a Gestapo informer? \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049902/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049902/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nFrench and German dialogue with English subtitles.\n\n\nI recorded this from an online stream, so, I don't think it's DVD quality, but I still think the audio and video are very nice and clear.\n\nIt was one of the few movies I could not find on this site, so once I found it elsewhere, I thought others might be looking for it as well, since it's a highly rated movie that many people have enjoyed.\n\n\nI've never uploaded a movie here before - I hope I've done it all correctly.\n\n\n:-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bea644047700bf42a1d39b13518e8b6c03932f2e","amp;dn":"A+Man+Escaped+1956","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bea644047700bf42a1d39b13518e8b6c03932f2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,166,68,4,119,0,191,66,161,211,155,19,81,142,139,108,3,147,47,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
