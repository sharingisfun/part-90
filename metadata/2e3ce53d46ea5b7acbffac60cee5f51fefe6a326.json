By consistently creating smaller archives, WinRAR is often faster than the competition. This will save you disc space, transmission costs AND valuable working time as well. WinRAR is ideal for multimedia files. WinRAR automatically recognizes and selects the best compression method. The special compression algorithm compresses multimedia files, executables and object libraries particularly well. WinRAR is a powerful archive manager (Win32). RAR files can usually compress by 8 percent to 15 percent more than ZIP files can. WinRAR is a powerful compression tool with many integrated additional functions to help you organize your compressed archives. It can backup your data and reduce size of email attachments, decompress RAR, ZIP and other files downloaded from Internet and create new archives in RAR and ZIP file format\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e3ce53d46ea5b7acbffac60cee5f51fefe6a326","amp;dn":"Wi5.11+%2B+Keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e3ce53d46ea5b7acbffac60cee5f51fefe6a326","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,60,229,61,70,234,91,122,203,255,172,96,206,229,245,31,239,230,163,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
