Dark Souls will  have  many  familiar\nfeatures: A dark fantasy  universe,  tense  dungeon\ncrawling,  fearsome  enemy  encounters  and  unique\nonline interactions.  Dark  Souls  is  a  spiritual\nsuccessor to Demon's, not a sequel. Prepare  for  a\nnew,   despair-inducing   world,   with   a   vast,\nfully-explorable  horizon  and  vertically-oriented\nlandforms. Prepare for  a  new,  mysterious  story,\ncentered around the the world of Lodran,  but  most\nof all, prepare to die.  You  will  face  countless\nmurderous traps, countless  darkly  grotesque  mobs\nand several gargantuan, supremely  powerful  demons\nand dragons bosses. You must learn  from  death  to\npersist through this  unforgiving  world.  And  you\naren't alone. Dark  Souls  allows  the  spirits  of\nother players to show up in your world, so you  can\nlearn from their deaths and  they  can  learn  from\nyours. You can also summon players into your  world\nto co-op adventure, or invade other's worlds to PVP\nbattle. New to Dark Souls are Bonfires, which serve\nas check points as you fight your way through  this\nepic adventure.  While  rested  at  Bonfires,  your\nhealth and magic replenish but at a cost, all  mobs\nrespawn. Beware: There is no place  in  Dark  Souls\nthat is truly safe. With days of game play  and  an\neven more punishing difficulty  level,  Dark  Souls\nwill be the most deeply challenging game  you  play\nthis year. Can you live through  a  million  deaths\nand earn your legacy?\n\n1- Unpack, burn or mount\n2- Install the game\n3- Copy the cracked content from PROPHET dir to\n&lt;installdir&gt;DATA folder\n4- Go To Hell!\n\nNOTE:\nWe present you the version with all  the  gamefiles\nupdated since the initial  release  and  with  G4WL\nremoved!
