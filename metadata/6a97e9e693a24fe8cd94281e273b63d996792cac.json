It aggregates some yarr streaming sights to basically let you watch whatever you want (within reason). (You still need a video player to play the content, but the stock player on most phones or tablets will work fine. If you need a video player http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-android.html is in beta as I type this, but usually works fine for me. \n\nRombuddy: This is for downloading ROM's for lots of old video game systems\n\nRombuddy PSX: This is for downloading PS1 games\n\nRetroArch: This is for playing all the ROM's you download with the Rombuddies.\n\nAll said and done, you can pretty much get and play any 5th generation or earlier console game, or watch any reasonably popular video content with this group of apps. Thank you developers, if you love this stuff give the folks who wrote it some bucks.
