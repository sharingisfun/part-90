Of all the valiant and talented warriors in this elite army, Badrinath (Allu Arjun) is one who is groomed by Bheeshma Narayan and wishes to make Badri his successor. Once, a group of terrorists attacked Amarnath Temple and killed some devotees, Badri fought and killed those criminals, saving both the temple and the devotees.\n\nMeanwhile Alakananda (Tamanna), who is a staunch agnostic due to certain circumstances, along with her family is visiting Badrinath Temple, to which Badri is appointed as the protector. Her grandfather explains to Badri that she is in danger as Sarkar (Kelly Dorjee), a dreaded don, is trying to force her marriage with his son. On the request of her grandfather, Badri helps Alaknanda to gradually believe in God's existence.\n\nEventually Alakananda falls deeply in love with Badri, unbeknownst to him, and is not willing to lose him at any cost. Sarkar and his men follow Alaknanda to Badrinath, and try to kidnap her. Although Badri manages to save her, he is heavily injured and goes under medication. Meanwhile Bheeshma Narayan is shocked upon seeing Alakananda's affectionate behaviour towards Badri when he lay injured. As it is a strict rule that only an unmarried man must be the next guru who would lead the elite warriors, Bheeshma Narayan becomes highly suspicious that Badri is in love with Alakananda, which is not the real situation. Badri promises Alakananda that he would bring her back to Badrinath Temple for success in her love, unaware that he is the object of her love in the first place.\n\nAs per the promise, Badri goes to Bellary to free Alakananda from the clutches of Sarkar, who is planning to fix the marriage, and escort Alaknanda back to the holy shrine. He fights with all the goons and escorts her to Badrinath. Sarkar vows revenge on Badri as Sarkar's son is severely hurt in the process by Badri. Subsequently Sarkar leads his goons to Badrinath and destroys Bheeshma Narayan's ashram.\n\nFeeling that Badri is the real traitor and loves Alakananda, Bheeshma Narayan orders Badri to vacate Badrinath Temple. Meanwhile Alakananda is being taken away by Sarkar's men, and Alakananda proposes to Badri to which he rejects as he has dedicated his life to his guru. After seeing Alakananda's pure love for Badri, Bheeshma Narayan is moved and orders Badri to bring her back and marry her. Following his guru's orders, Badri saves Alakananda and finally marries her. In the end, Bheeshma Narayan asks them to hand over one of their children so that he can make him his successor to which they agree happily.\nCast\n\n    Allu Arjun as Badrinath\n    Tamannaah Bhatia as Alakananda\n    Prakash Raj as Guru Beeshma Narayana\n    Kelly Dorji as Sarkar\n    Ashwini Kalsekar as Sarkar's wife\n    Pragathi as Alakananda's maid\n    Rao Ramesh\n    Tanikella Bharani as Badrinath's father\n    Kovai Sarala as Badrinath's mother\n    Bramhanandam as Batting Baba\n    Dharmavarapu Subrahmanyam\n    M.
