Like Dylan himself, the resulting conversation, as published in February, 1966, is by turns illuminating and completely confounding. Topics shift abruptly, words take on unfamiliar meanings, and for all of the many strong opinions Dylan seems to express, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remarkable how little he actually seems to say, since he takes back almost everything as soon as he says it.\n\n&quot;Well, I never felt as if thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an answer through pot. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to make this, kind of, a drug interview or anything, like. LSD likeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ once you take LSD a few timesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ I mean, LSD is a medicine. You know, you take it and you knowÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really have to keep taking it all the time. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing like that. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not that kind of thing, you know, whereas pot, you know, nobodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got any answers through pot. PotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, you know, not that kind of thing. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure that the people that say that the people who figure they got their answers through pot, first of all, those people who say that, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just inventing something. And the people that really actually think that they got their answers through pot, probably never even smoked pot, you know. I mean, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s likeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ pot is, you knowÃ¢â‚¬Â¦who smokes pot any more, you know, anyway?&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ceb9186abd2b656417241042a8b5aae1400f5056","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Playboy+interview+%281965%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ceb9186abd2b656417241042a8b5aae1400f5056","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,185,24,106,189,43,101,100,23,36,16,66,168,181,170,225,64,15,80,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
