Because geocoding is nothing without data, it provides an easy to use importer that will automagically download and import the necessary (free) data to your local database (Geonames and OpenStreetMap : 42 million entries). You can also add your own data with the Web interface or the importer connectors provided. Gisgraphy is production ready, and has been designed to be scalable(load balanced), performant and used in other languages than just java : results can be output in XML, JSON, PHP, Python, Ruby, YAML, GeoRSS, and Atom. One of the most popular GPS tracking System (OpenGTS) also includes a Gisgraphy client...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIt was also a giant pain in the ass to set up, so I exported an appliance and now I share it with you. The appliance was exported before importing all the map and location data, so that still needs to be done once you've got the server up and running. \n\nGisgraphy can be accessed via http://IP:8080.\nGisgraphy admin console is at http://IP:8080/admin\nWebmin can be accessed via https://IP:10000.\n\nGisgraphy login: admin/admin\nWebmin or console login: gisgraphyuser/password\nTHE ROOT PASSWORD IS 'password' but Ubuntu doesn't let you ssh as root, you must sudo from a user account.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5769f52280322c8b63d1caae54db57e2e650de52","amp;dn":"Gisgraphy+3.0beta2+on+Ubuntu+14.04.1+Appliance+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5769f52280322c8b63d1caae54db57e2e650de52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,105,245,34,128,50,44,139,99,209,202,174,84,219,87,226,230,80,222,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
