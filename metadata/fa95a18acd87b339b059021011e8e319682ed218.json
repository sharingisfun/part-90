Travel through stunning landscapes straight out of an animated film. Battle painstakingly hand-animated foes in strategic, turn-based combat harkening back to the classic &quot;Tactics&quot; days of gaming. Make decisions with consequences in conversations with people you'll truly care about. And throughout the whole thing record the history of your people on your banner where it will be remembered, because soon there might not be anything left.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\nUnzip\n\nMove ENTIRE folder over to Applications (not just the Banner Saga app)\n\nEnjoy\n\nSeed!
