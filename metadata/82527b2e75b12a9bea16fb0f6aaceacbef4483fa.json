But recruiting Dashiel Riske as her unofficial partner is a whole other kind of danger. Dash is 6'4&quot; of laid-back masculine charm, a man who loves life-- and women-- to the limit. Until Margo is threatened, and he reveals a dark side that may just match her own. Beneath Margo's tough facade is a slow-burning sexiness that drives Dash crazy. The only way to finish this case is to work together side by sideskin to skin. And as their mission takes a lethal turn, he'll have to prove he's all the man she needs-- in all the ways that matter.
