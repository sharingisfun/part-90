As Cohen grows up, he must face friends and classmates who don't realize that he sometimes cannot control his outbursts, and a father (Treat Williams) who seems unwilling to accept his son's condition.\n\n\nRatings: 8.2/10 from 3,202 users","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce4ec217b7ff2db2ff1500dc999bf80fcbf217d5","amp;dn":"Front+of+the+Class+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce4ec217b7ff2db2ff1500dc999bf80fcbf217d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,78,194,23,183,255,45,178,255,21,0,220,153,155,248,15,203,242,23,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
