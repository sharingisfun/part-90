This is a REAL classic CD, one that every R&amp;B fan should own. Tracks like &quot;Love's Train&quot;, &quot;In My Bed&quot;, &quot;April Showers&quot;, &quot;Tell Me&quot;, &quot;Do You Believe?&quot;, &quot;All Alone, &quot;5 Steps&quot;, and &quot;Never Make A Promise&quot; are some of the best songs that I have ever heard by a male R&amp;B group. They all show their range on every song which makes it so special. I wish they would come out with another classic!!! I miss DRU HILL!!!![/quote] ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9ccf4ae41a7c0f3816567bc5397401874e54d57","amp;dn":"Dru+Hill+-+DRU+HILL+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1996+R%26amp%3BB+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9ccf4ae41a7c0f3816567bc5397401874e54d57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,204,244,174,65,167,192,243,129,101,103,188,83,151,64,24,116,229,77,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
