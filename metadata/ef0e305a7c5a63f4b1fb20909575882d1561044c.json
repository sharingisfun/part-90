However, giving the devil his due, I must admit that Mr. Glass has written, minimalist though it is, a series of gothic set pieces brimming with atmosphere, gloom and vampires. The thematic material, woven in and out by the exceptionally attuned Kronos Quartet, goes through typical Glass permutations but never seems to become tiresome; in fact, the more one listens, the more one hears. Glass has caught something quite intangible here and it deserves a listen.... best at night with your headphones on.... and with garlic hung from windows and doors!\n\nVideo info: XviD - 544x368 - 23.976fps - 1h 14mn 21s 624ms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef0e305a7c5a63f4b1fb20909575882d1561044c","amp;dn":"Dracula+%28Kronos+Quartet+and+Philip+Glass%29+%5B1931%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef0e305a7c5a63f4b1fb20909575882d1561044c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,14,48,90,124,90,99,244,177,251,32,144,149,117,136,45,21,97,4,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
