(If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know what that means read up on it here: http://haruhichan.com/wpblog/?p=205)\nIf you have problems with any of the above, this release is not for you.\nWe will try to release at least 3 episodes a week, but retiming subs to the R2 source and OCR takes time. We are also short on QC staff, so we might look for another QC soon.\nIf you find any problems/bugs in the releases please report them with the following info; Episode, Timestamp, MediaPlayer and what kind of problem.\nRelease date: 2012-03-04\nRelease reason: No releases we find good enough for our favorite show.\nSource: DVD R2 EP001-136, not sure if we are going to use DVD R1 for rest or buy rest of the boxsets.\nVideo: CRF 15 768Ãƒâ€”576 10bit.\nAudio: JAP 2.0 AAC\nSubs: DVD R1 mixed with AonE.\n\nSome more technical release notes for those interested:\nThe R1 and R2 sources are really bad, both contain massive dotcrawl and rainbowing, broken frames due to quantization errors i mpeg2. One of the reasons this project has taken so much time was to find a good way to remove most of the dotcrawl and rainbowing without sacrificing video detail, after a lot of scripting in avisynth we finally found a solution, though there is still some residual dotcrawl on very high motion scenes which we where unable to remove without destroying the detail completely. (The dotcrawl and rainbowing in Naruto was our motivation for our banner on this blog). ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an average of 10 applyrange in each episode script and quite big OVR files for tfm to fix various problems in the source.\nWe made some comprative screenshots against Blu-DragonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s release which seems to be the most popular (No idea why though, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not even decimated): http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/110985/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fd0c02cd0ab74db3e2b3e9a8690a20bbd4b7b1a","amp;dn":"Naruto+%28Yellow-Flash%29+%5BFanEdit%5D+Seasons+1%26amp%3B2+%28Eps+001-083%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fd0c02cd0ab74db3e2b3e9a8690a20bbd4b7b1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,208,192,44,208,171,116,219,62,43,62,154,134,144,162,11,189,75,123,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
