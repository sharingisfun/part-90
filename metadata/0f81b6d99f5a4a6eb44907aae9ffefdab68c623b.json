He survives and becomes a stoker at the monastery, but is perpetually overcome with guilt.\n\nThirty years pass... Anatoly now has the gift of clairvoyance and healing.

He often gets in a boat and goes to an uninhabited island where he prays for mercy and forgiveness.\n\nA prominent admiral arrives to see Anatoly with his daughter. The daughter is possessed by demons but Anatoly exorcises them. The admiral turns out to be Tikhon. It is revealed that Anatoly only wounded him during the war. Tikhon forgives Anatoly.\n\nAnatoly can now die peacefully. The monks discover that he has foreknowledge of his death and make him a coffin out of a coal box. he lies down in it, and dies.
