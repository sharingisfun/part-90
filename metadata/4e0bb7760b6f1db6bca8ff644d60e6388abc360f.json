In this training we'll be learning a creative process on how to create a creature concept that would function as a game enemy. \n\nWe'll begin this process by discussing some conceptual parameters for our concept that will help provide a stronger sense of direction when sketching our creature designs. From here we'll learn a process of generating contrasting designs by focusing on poses and a silhouette approach. Following this we'll decide on a design in addition to roughing in some textures and base colors that will function as supportive elements for us to build upon as we begin to paint over the entire sketch fleshing out specific portions. \n\nFinally, we'll round out our creature concept with an overall paint-over to add details to really make it pop. After watching this training, you'll have the inspiration and motivation to bring your own creature concepts to life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e0bb7760b6f1db6bca8ff644d60e6388abc360f","amp;dn":"Developing+Creature+Concepts+for+Games+-+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e0bb7760b6f1db6bca8ff644d60e6388abc360f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,11,183,118,11,111,29,182,188,168,255,100,77,96,230,56,138,188,54,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
