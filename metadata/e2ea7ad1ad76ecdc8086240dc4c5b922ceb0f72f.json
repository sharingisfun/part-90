That Chris Abani is able to find humanity, mercy, and even, yes, forgiveness, amid such devastation is something of a miracle.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Rebecca Brown, author of The End of Youth\n\n&quot;The moment you enter these pages, you step into a beautiful and terrifying dream. You are in the hands of a master, a literary shaman. Abani casts his spell so completelyÃ¢â‚¬â€so devastatinglyÃ¢â‚¬â€you emerge cleansed, redeemed, and utterly haunted.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€Brad Kessler, author of Birds in Fall\n\nPart Inferno, part Paradise Lost, and part Sunjiata epic, Song for Night is the story of a West African boy soldierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrical, terrifying, yet beautiful journey through the nightmare landscape of a brutal war in search of his lost platoon. The reader is led by the voiceless protagonist who, as part of a land mine-clearing platoon, had his vocal chords cut, a move to keep these children from screaming when blown up, and thereby distracting the other minesweepers. The book is written in a ghostly voice, with each chapter headed by a line of the unique sign language these children invented. This book is unlike anything else ever written about an African war.\n\nChris Abani is a Nigerian poet and novelist and the author of The Virgin of Flames, Becoming Abigail (a New York Times EditorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choice), and GraceLand (a selection of the Today Show Book Club and winner of the 2005 PEN/Hemingway Prize and the Hurston/Wright Legacy Award). His other prizes include a PEN Freedom to Write Award, a Prince Claus Award, and a Lannan Literary Fellowship. He lives and teaches in California.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2ea7ad1ad76ecdc8086240dc4c5b922ceb0f72f","amp;dn":"Song+for+Night+by+Chris+Abani+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2ea7ad1ad76ecdc8086240dc4c5b922ceb0f72f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,234,122,209,173,118,236,220,128,134,36,13,196,197,185,34,206,176,247,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
