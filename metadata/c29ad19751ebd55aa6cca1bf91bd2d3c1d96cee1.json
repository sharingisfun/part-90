Coming to prominence towards the end of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, Venom's first two albumsÃ¢â‚¬â€Welcome to Hell (1981) and Black Metal (1982)Ã¢â‚¬â€are considered a major influence on thrash metal and extreme metal in general. Venom's second album proved influential enough that its title was used as the name of an extreme metal\n\n\nExtreme / black metal pioneers Venom have just announced the release of their 14th studio album! The upcoming record, Ã¢â‚¬ËœFrom the Very Depths,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ has been locked in for a Jan. 27 street date via Spinefarm Records.\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœFrom the Very DepthsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ will feature 14 new tracks from Venom, acting as the follow-up to 2011Ã¢â‚¬Â²s Ã¢â‚¬ËœFallen Angels.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ And for you vinyl junkies, Venom plan to give Ã¢â‚¬ËœFrom the Very DepthsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ a double LP release shortly after the Jan. 27 CD / digital launch.\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This album is perfect, all three members are totally over-the-top confident with the new songs and the production,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Venom frontman Cronos. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We had a great atmosphere in the studio while we were recording. Dante created pure thunder from his drums, while Rage tears the flesh off your face with his riffs, making everything fall into place so well. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a strong release and really shows the band maturing into an unstoppable force of pure Black Metal. We canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait to play the new songs live for the LegionsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Hell Yeah!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nIn other Venom news, the band was just confirmed for 70,000 Tons of Metal. Venom will perform Ã¢â‚¬ËœFrom the Very DepthsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in full as one of their two sets while on board the 2015 high-seas festival\n\nDiscography:\nStudio albums\nWelcome to Hell (1981)\nBlack Metal (1982)\nAt War with Satan (1984)\nPossessed (1985)\nCalm Before the Storm (1987)\nPrime Evil (1989)\nTemples of Ice (1991)\nThe Waste Lands (1992)\nCast in Stone (1997)\nResurrection (2000)\nMetal Black (2006)\nHell (2008)\nFallen Angels (2011)\nFrom the Very Depths (2015)\n\n\n\nLive albums\nOfficial Bootleg (1985)\nEine Kleine Nachtmusik (1986)\nThe Second Coming (1987)\nBitten (2002)\nWitching Hour (2003)\n\n\n\nCompilation albums\nAmerican Assault (EP, 1985)\nCanadian Assault (EP, 1985)\nFrench Assault (EP, 1985)\nScandinavian Assault (EP, 1985)\nGerman Assault (EP, 1987)\nJapanese Assault (1985)\nFrom Hell to the Unknown...
