A close friendship was forged through sharing a decade of life experience that would ultimately serve as the creative nucleus for this project.\n\n\nQuote:\nThe advent of the band RUBICON CROSS is rooted in the connection formed between two prolific musicians facing adverse conditions together. The friendship between vocalist CJ Snare and guitarist Chris Green is as solid as the bond that they share as songwriting collaborators and that bond is the creative nucleus for this recording.\nimage\nThe two first met backstage while sharing the same stage at a rock festival in Madrid. From relationship break-ups to standing next to each other as best men at each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s weddings, they have traveled the bumpy road of life as best friends. CJ is godfather to ChrisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ toddler son and for over a decade they have experienced heartaches, hangovers and even transcontinental relocations together. With this kind of solidarity, it was inevitable that they would become bandmates.\n\nFor the last two decades, both CJ and Chris have been making a bountiful living practicing their craft. Their career achievements would be the envy of any professional musician: Award winning vocalist, CJ Snare, a native of Tampa, Florida is a founding member, primary songwriter and lead vocalist for the supremely successful, multi-Platinum-selling hard rock outfit, Firehouse. Highly respected London-born guitar virtuoso Chris Green is a founding member of both internationally known metal bands Pride and Furyon.\n\nWhat initially began as a solo project for CJ soon became a collaborative effort between two like-minded craftsmen. And, as all creative people will attest, the creative process often dictates policy--as opposed to the other way around. Immediately upon the completion of the first song they wrote together, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Moving On,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they knew that it was going to be something completely new and different for them both.\n\nSome projects just have to be made. And for this one, they knew that they would need to do it outside of their other pursuits.\n\nTogether they formed RUBICON CROSS. With the addition of Pride/Furyon bassist Simon Farmery (who co-wrote, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Save Me WithinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Seventh Omen drummer Robert Behnke, and second guitarist Jeff Lerman, RUBICON CROSS became a band of brothers, willing to tackle the music, the road, and bring life to these songs of fight, commitment and connection.\n\nThe lush melodic core of the songwriting is given a forceful, aggressive boost on this record. From the first single, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bleed With MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that starts just as propulsive as it ends to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kill Or Be KilledÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that has a relentless metal drive, RUBICON CROSS is a collection of contemporary heavy music that sits just as comfortably next to hard rock classics as it does modern rock upstarts. The opening track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Locked and LoadedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is featured on the Xbox360 and PS3 game Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dirt ShowdownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ along side of new rock heavy-hitters Rise Against, Rival Sons and The Parlor Mob.\n\nWith all of the life experience, career accomplishments and expert musicianship between them, it was a Ã¢â‚¬Å“no-brainerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for Universal distributed label, INgrooves, to sign them upon hearing the finished tracks on this remarkable debut offering.\nimage\n\nQuote:\nFollowing the release of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2003 studio album, Ã¢â‚¬ËœPrime Time,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ FireHouse lead vocalist CJ Snare has remained somewhat isolated from the familiar position of recording new material.\n\nAside from the occasional solo single or collection of re-recorded FireHouse songs which dedicated listeners were already well familiar with, established fans have patiently waited more than a decade to hear Snare offer his voice to a new collection of explosive, in-your-face energetic anthems.\n\nThe lengthy wait ends with Rubicon Cross, the new project which features the hard rock frontman at the helm while supported by members of the modern heavy metal groups Seventh Omen, Pride, and Furyon.\n\nWe should be quick to note that listeners coming into the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eponymous debut album who are expecting a compilation of FireHouse songs should turn away and return with an open mindset; the well-preserved range of Snare does attribute more than enough familiar qualities to attract the FireHouse audience, however Rubicon Cross is band with a sound all their own.\n\nThe albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opening number Ã¢â‚¬Å“Locked and LoadedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sets the tone for the rest of the record, boasting a large anthemic chorus, bottom-heavy bass lines and war machine guitar licks. The songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s properly implemented use of audience roars has it destined to be a Rubicon Cross live stable, while itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dueling guitar solos, which end up becoming a familiar factor throughout the record, attributes a moderate power metal edge.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“You Will Remember MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is definitely one of the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brightest highlights, which in addition to a cast of solid chord progressions features some brilliant lyrical content from Snare, showing the vocalist taking a vindictive stance against a former significant other. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The best you had/Too late, too bad/You will remember me,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Snare belts while producing some memorable, soaring vocal harmonies, warmly reminiscent of his earlier efforts with the short-lived Maxx Warrior.\n\nIn contrast, selections such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bleed With MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Kill or Be KilledÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ have Snare embodying a gravely rumble which, while not the most original, compliments Rubicon CrossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ commanding rhythm section and allows the moments where the singer returns to his familiar range to remain all-the-more standout. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Save Me WithinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ upon first impression disguises itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true identity as a traditional glam metal power ballad, complete with articulate acoustic guitar, before locking into high octane mode with unforgiving distortion and menacing overtones.\n\nHands down the most genuinely surprising moment on the album, Ã¢â‚¬Å“All the Little ThingsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ concludes the effort with a lighthearted punk rocker in the same vein as Green Day, and even shows Snare adopting a singing style slightly reminiscent of Billie Joe Armstrong. The end result actually ends up working better than one might initially think, and could easily serve as a strong choice for a new radio single.\n\nRubicon CrossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ self-titled debut studio album is a solid introduction to a standout collaboration, which includes one of the more attention-grabbing rosters in the genre. Albeit he never exactly went anywhere, having CJ Snare return on a new album of original material is exciting on itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own; the fact that the music itself is standout only adds to the elation.\n\n\n\nRubicon Cross:\n\nCJ Snare / Vocals\nChris Green / Lead Guitars\nSimon Farmery / Bass\nRobert Behnke / Drums\nJeff Lerman / Guitar\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Rubicon Cross&quot; track listing:\n\n01.
