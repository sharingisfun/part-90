The book examines his proposed revolutionary reform Ã¢â‚¬â€ to abandon traditional metaphysics and point philosophy in a new direction Ã¢â‚¬â€ and contends that critics have misrepresented conflicts between Kant and his predecessors. Kant, Bird argues, was not a flawed innovator but an advocate of a new philosophical project, one that began to be appreciated only in the twentieth century.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:888eb87e76d7f11b685ebb95e2eebdd8bc210d8d","amp;dn":"Graham+Bird+-+The+Revolutionary+Kant%3A+A+Commentary+on+the+Critiq","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"888eb87e76d7f11b685ebb95e2eebdd8bc210d8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,142,184,126,118,215,241,27,104,94,187,149,226,238,189,216,188,33,13,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
