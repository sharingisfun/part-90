The album charted as high as #36 in the U.K. and was phenomenally successful in Canada, going gold, platinum, and double-platinum. Cohen also won the Canadian Juno Award for Best Male Vocalist in 1993 for The Future. In his acceptance speech, he quipped, &quot;Only in Canada could somebody with a voice like mine win Vocalist of the Year&quot;.\n\n\n As with most every Leonard Cohen album, a new record means a new means of musical exploration. With The Future, Cohen adds chiming synthesizers and eerie orchestrations to his brooding anthems about life's darker half. One of the last of Cohen's full-length albums, The Future is definitely one of the most direct. More notable tracks include &quot;The Future&quot; and &quot;Waiting for the Miracle,&quot; both of which were featured on the Natural Born Killers soundtrack. Closer to spoken word poetry set to music than simply songs, the entire album is one long manifesto calling all to challenge the concepts of righteousness and despair in our modern world. Regardless of the music behind the man, Cohen still manages to bring to The Future what he brought to his earlier recordings: one man against the world with nothing but a gruff voice and a cause.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - The Future\n 02 - Waiting for the Miracle\n 03 - Be for Real\n 04 - Closing Time\n 05 - Anthem\n 06 - Democracy\n 07 - Light as the Breeze\n 08 - Always\n 09 - Tacoma Trailer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4603edffa631dc037b6310913a9d84c0783e5d8","amp;dn":"Leonard+Cohen+-+The+Future+%281992%2F2015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4603edffa631dc037b6310913a9d84c0783e5d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,96,62,223,250,99,29,192,55,182,49,9,19,169,216,76,7,131,229,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
