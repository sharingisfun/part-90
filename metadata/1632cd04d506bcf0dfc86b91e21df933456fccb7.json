The\nfirst task sees the group split for the first time, as the contenders abseil down a 300ft\nwaterfall one by one. They then have to build a camp without their usual supplies, before\ntucking into the evening's dinner rats, which must be gutted and cooked. The next morning,\nthe team tackles a dense mangrove swamp, following the sound of a distress signal in an\nattempt to reach assistant Scott, and with the end in sight, Bear has one final challenge\nin store.\n\n                                 Enjoy!\n\n  Greetings To: aAF BARGE BiA FTP FoV HAGGiS RiVER SomeTV TASTETV WATERS \n\n     We are currently looking for:\n     * US/UK cappers with HDTV/PDTV/DSR feed (1Mbit+ Upload Speed)\n     * Legit .EU 100MBit+ sites to affil (no rented/colo/leaseweb)\n\n               E-mail enquires to","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1632cd04d506bcf0dfc86b91e21df933456fccb7","amp;dn":"Bear.Grylls.Mission.Survive.S01E06.HDTV.x264-C4TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1632cd04d506bcf0dfc86b91e21df933456fccb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,50,205,4,213,6,188,240,223,200,107,145,226,29,249,51,69,111,204,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
