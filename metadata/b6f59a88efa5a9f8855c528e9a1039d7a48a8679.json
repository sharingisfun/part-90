There are no rules to follow: just you, a physics sandbox, and your friends. Make your own games and play how YOU want! Unlimited gaming possibilities!&quot;\n\nFAQ\nQ: Does the multiplayer work in this version?\nA: As of now (17.09.2014), it does. Even when this version becomes outdated, you can host a server and play with friends, as long as you have the same version.\n\nTo change your in-game name, open LumaEmu.ini.\nYou'd better change it right after you install the game, because some people would ban you on their servers just because you have the default name.\n\nApparently, the game supports mods, but I haven't tested them. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nexusmods.com/tabletopsimulator&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nexusmods.com/tabletopsimulator&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it!  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/286160&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/286160&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.humblebundle.com/store/p/tabletopsimulator_storefront&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.humblebundle.com/store/p/tabletopsimulator_storefront&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6f59a88efa5a9f8855c528e9a1039d7a48a8679","amp;dn":"Tabletop+Simulator+v2.6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6f59a88efa5a9f8855c528e9a1039d7a48a8679","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,245,154,136,239,165,169,248,133,92,82,142,154,16,57,215,164,138,134,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
