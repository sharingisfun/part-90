Journey around the world and see that only the KJV matches the pure scriptures preserved &quot;to all generations&quot; and &quot;to all nations,&quot; including the Greek, Hebrew, Old Italia, Italian, Dutch, German, French, Spanish and others.\n\nTHIS BOOK is the first and only documented history of the words of the Holy Bible. It is based on word-for-word and letter-by-letter analysis of a vault of ancient, rare and valuable Bibles.

See for yourself the unbroken preservation of the pure holy scriptures, from the first century to today's beloved King James Bible. Watch the English language and its Holy Bible unfold before your very eyes.\n\nExamine the letters and sounds, shown in red, which bind the words of each successive Bible from the Gothic, Anglo-Saxon, pre-Wycliffe, Tyndale, Coverdale, Great, Geneva, and Bishops' to the King James Bible. Uncover time-buried eyewitness reports, views and Bible study secrets of history's great translators and martyrs. See word-for-word collations, aided by the KJV translators' newly discovered notes, revealing exactly how the KJV translators polished the sword of the Spirit.\n\nWatch in horror as the destroyer, through the NIV, TNIV, HCSB, NKJV, NASB and ESV, teams up with Jehovah Witness and Catholic versions to silence the utterances of the Holy Ghost.
