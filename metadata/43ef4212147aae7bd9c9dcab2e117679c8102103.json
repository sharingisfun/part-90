PenguiNet includes an SCP browser, so that you can easily transfer files with just a few mouseclicks.\n\nTabbed connections\nUse one copy of PenguiNet to open as many Telnet and SSH connections as you need. Session windows can be any size, fullscreen, and can be resized at any time. Switch easily between sessions with tabbed browsing and the CTRL-TAB hotkey.\n\nEasy organisation\nOrganise the hosts you use hierarchically. A child profile can inherit settings from a parent, saving you time and cascading your preferences from the top down. Double-click an SSH-capable host to open the file browser window, then double-click any file for immediate SCP transfer!\n\nColours\nSession windows can be in any colour and in any non-proportional font. Configure your session windows to open windowed or fullscreen, at the size you choose. Configure a background image behind your working windows.\n\nSupported OS:\n\nWindows 2000 and newer\n\nHomepage: http://www.siliconcircus.com/\n\nInstallation Instructions: \n\n- Install program.\n- Copy content from crack folder and paste into default installation directory.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43ef4212147aae7bd9c9dcab2e117679c8102103","amp;dn":"Silicon+Circus+PenguiNet+v2.61+Incl+Crack+-+CRD+%5BTotDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43ef4212147aae7bd9c9dcab2e117679c8102103","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,239,66,18,20,122,174,123,217,201,220,171,46,17,118,121,200,16,33,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
