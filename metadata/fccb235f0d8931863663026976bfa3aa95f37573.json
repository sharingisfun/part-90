His older son Koichi is married with Akiko that are compulsive consumers and Akiko financially controls their expenses. Hirayama frequently meets his old friends Kawai and Professor Horie, who is married with a younger wife, to drink in a bar. When their school teacher Sakuma comes to a reunion of Hirayama with old school mates, they learn that the old man lives with his daughter that stayed single to take care of him. Michiko lives a happy life with her father and her brother, but Hirayama feels that it is time to let her go and tries to arrange a marriage for her. - Written by Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil \n\nVideo: AVC\n\nAudio: Japanese LPCM Audio 1.0 / 48 kHz / 1152 kbps / 24-bit\n ..........
