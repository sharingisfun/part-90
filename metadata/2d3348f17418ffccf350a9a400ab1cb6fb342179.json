Three years after\nthe outbreak, US Army virologist Lieutenant Colonel Robert Neville (Will Smith) lives\nin New York City as what he believes to be the last uninfected human in the world\n\nNeville's daily routine includes experimentation on infected rats to find a cure for\nthe virus and trips through a deserted Manhattan to hunt for food and supplies. He\nalso waits each day for a response to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts, which\ninstruct any uninfected survivors to meet him at midday at the South Street Seaport\nFlashbacks reveal that his wife and daughter died in a helicopter accident during the\nchaotic evacuation of Manhattan, prior to the military-enforced quarantine of the\nisland in 2009. Neville's isolation is broken only by the companionship of his dog\nSam, interaction with mannequins he has set up as patrons of a video store, and\nrecordings of old television broadcasts. At night, he barricades himself and Sam\ninside his house to hide from the Darkseekers.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imgbox.com/8vPCcDcx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imgbox.com/8vPCcDcx&lt;/a&gt;\n\n:: General ::\n\nFormat: Matroska/MKV\nFile Size: 4.11 GiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 5.6 MB\nFormat profile: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4109282629010d756f70&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nDuration: 01h:43m:54s\nSample: No\nSubtitles: English/Chinese/Arabic/Indonesian/\nBulgarian/scr/Czech/Estonian/\nHebrew/Hungarian/Icelandic/Latvian/\nCzech/Hungarian/Polish/Arabic/\nLithuanian/Polish/Romanian/Russian/\nSerbian/Slovenian/Thai/Turkish/\nUkrainian/Hungarian/\nChapters: Yes\nEncoded By oneanight\n\n:: Video Info ::\n\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nWriting library: x264\nVideo bitrate: 4 MB\nResolution: 1920 X 800 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR): 2.40:1\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\n\n:: Audio Info ::\n\nFormat profile: TrueHD\nBit rate: 3366 Kbps\nCompression mode: Lossless\nBit rate mode Variable\nAudio Language: English\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz\nBit depth: 24 bits\nChannel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nChannels: 5.1 Surround\n\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d3348f17418ffccf350a9a400ab1cb6fb342179","amp;dn":"I+Am+Legend+-+%5B2007%5D+1080p+BDRip+x264+TrueHD+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d3348f17418ffccf350a9a400ab1cb6fb342179","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,51,72,241,116,24,255,204,243,80,169,164,0,171,28,182,251,52,33,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
