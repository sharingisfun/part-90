Chelsea have never won at St James' Park in the league under Jose Mourinho, and their previous two visits have ended in defeat. Elsewhere, Arsenal take on a Stoke team who have a fantastic record over Arsene Wenger's side at the Britannia Stadium, with just one defeat in the Premier League. Plus a London derby between Tottenham and Crystal Palace, while the champions Manchester City host Everton in the evening kick-off. Early-season strugglers QPR and Burnley meet at Loftus Road, Hull are at home to West Brom and Liverpool host Sunderland.\n\n\nOverall bit rate                         : 4 675 Kbps\nFrame rate                               : 50.000 fps\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=5 / deblock=1:-3:-3 /  me=umh / subme=10 me_range=24 /","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82b8bfd3c215ea36a0931a1c69343b763b37e238","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+2014-12-06+720p+50fps+HDTV+x264-wAm.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82b8bfd3c215ea36a0931a1c69343b763b37e238","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,184,191,211,194,21,234,54,160,147,26,28,105,52,59,118,59,55,226,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
