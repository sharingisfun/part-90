So here it is.\n\nIf you want a complete mod with gameplay changes and new features you can download the full versions of my Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4 mods from\n\n\n-----------------\nINCLUDED FEATURES\n-----------------\n\n* Removed mouse acceleration (credit to Redditor Cr1N for discovering this!)\n\n* Replaced the startup movies with blank .bik files.\n\n------------\nINSTALLATION\n------------\n\nThis mod is installed like most Far Cry mods so if you have any experience with that this should be old hat to you. However if you are new to mods just remember this one golden rule: BACK UP your SAVE GAMES and your PATCH_HD.DAT &amp; PATCH_HD.FAT files. More instructions below.\n\nTL:DR - You should probably backup your saves (though I doubt it will do anything to them). Backup your patch_hd.dat &amp; patch_hd.fat files. Replace patch_hd.dat and patch_hd.fat with this mods versions. \n\nSTEP 1\nMake back up copies (copy and paste) of your save games and the following two files:\npatch_hd.dat\npatch_hd.fat\n\nYour save games should be located around:\nC:Program Files (x86)UbisoftUbisoft Game Launchersavegames[long randomnumber]420 \n(420 might be 856 or another number depending on the version of FC4 you have - i.e. deluxe, standard, gold, etc.)\n\npatch_hd.dat &amp; patch_hd.fat are located wherever your main Far Cry 4 directory is located:\n[install path]Far Cry 4data_win32\n\n\nSTEP 2\nOnce you have backed those files up you simply copy the patch_hd.dat &amp; patch_hd.fat files from this mod into your data_win32 folder (overwrite the old ones if asked - be sure they are backed up!)\n\n-------\nCREDITS\n-------\nRedditor Cr1N for locating the mouse acceleration code ()\n\nJRavens (me) for implementing the changes and packing them up into path_hd for you so you don't have to futz with it ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19d32306af07828cb944a4160da4688ea6343a06","amp;dn":"Farcry+4+Mod%3A+Remove+Mouse+Acceleration+%26amp%3B+No+Intro+Fix+%28far+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19d32306af07828cb944a4160da4688ea6343a06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,211,35,6,175,7,130,140,185,68,164,22,13,164,104,142,166,52,58,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
