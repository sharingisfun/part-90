Though their music was initially categorised as progressive rock, they later incorporated a combination of traditional rock, pop and art rock into their music. The band's work is marked by the songwriting of Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson and the prominent use of Wurlitzer electric piano and saxophone.\n\nWhile the band's early work was mainstream progressive rock, they would enjoy greater commercial success when they incorporated more conventional and radio-friendly elements into their work in the mid-1970s, going on to sell more than 60 million albums. HodgsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s song &quot;Dreamer&quot; became their first hit single and drove the Crime of the Century album to the top of the charts. They reached their commercial peak with 1979's Breakfast in America, which has sold more than 20 million copies.\n\nThough their albums were generally far more successful than their singles, Supertramp did enjoy a number of major hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot;, &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot;, &quot;The Logical Song&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot;, &quot;Take the Long Way Home&quot;, &quot;Dreamer&quot;, &quot;Breakfast in America&quot;, &quot;It's Raining Again&quot;, and &quot;Cannonball&quot;. The band attained significant popularity in the United States, Canada, Europe, South Africa and Australia. Since Hodgson's departure in 1983, founder Rick Davies has led the band by himself","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b61037bc0673378e63d20e0e1d35304f04387102","amp;dn":"Supertramp+Vinyl+24bit%26amp%3BSACD+Collection+1970-1987","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b61037bc0673378e63d20e0e1d35304f04387102","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,16,55,188,6,115,55,142,99,210,14,14,29,53,48,79,4,56,113,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
