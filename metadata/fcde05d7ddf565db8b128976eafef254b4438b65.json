One hundred percent of the proceeds from the Cities Sampler benefit Minnesota charities. Cities 97 has raised nearly two million dollars and has contributed to programs like &quot;Cities Kids&quot; - a partnership with the Community University Health Center that brings health and wellness care to children in need in the Twin Cities - and many others. Thank you for making this unique CD such a huge success!\n\nÃ‚Â© 1999 KTCZ 97.1 FM\nAll rights reserved.
