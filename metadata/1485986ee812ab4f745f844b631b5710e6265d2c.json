Mickey tries to bury the bad news with the body, but when the boy's mother demands the truth, Mickey finds himself stuck in a life-and-death struggle between a body he can't bury, a wife he can't please and a debt he can't pay.\n\n\nDirector..........:  John Slattery\n\nWriters...........:  Alex Metcalf &amp; John Slattery (Screenplay)     \n\nStarring..........:  Philip Seymour Hoffman, Christina Hendricks           \n\n\niMDB URL..........: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2920808&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2920808&lt;/a&gt;\nSOURCE TYPE.......:  Retail Blu-Ray 20,7 GB Movie @ 25939 kbps / 22,3 GB Full\nViDEO SPECS.......:  x264 2PASS @ 14000+ Kbps (&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;eea6878986aea2dac0df&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;) - 23.976 fps\nAUDiO SPECS 1.....:  English DTS-HD Master 5.1 3225 kbps 48 kHz 24 bit\nAUDiO SPECS 2.....:  Commentary Director John Slattery  \nRUNTiME...........:  1h 28 min\nMOViE CROPPED.....:  No\nFiLM ASPECT RATiO.:  2.35:1 Anamorphic Scope / Letterbox\nRESOLUTiON........:  1920 X 1080\nEXTRAS............:  Yes\nSUBTiTLES.........:  English, panish\nSUBTiTLES EXTRAS..:  Sorry no Subtitles on Disc\n\n\nNOTE: RIP Philip Seymour Hoffman.

Thanks!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   \n   Q &amp; A:\n\n1) How do I Bitstream TrueHD &amp; DTS-HD Master audio From my PC to My surround\n   Receiver?\n   \n   Part 1 - Setting up Sound / Bitstreaming in Windows (Only read and Use first\n   Part about Windows):\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.mediasmartserver.net/2010/02/02/guide-setting-up-bitstreaming-with-your-windows-7-htpc-part-i/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.mediasmartserver.net/2010/02/02/guide-setting-up-bitstreaming-with-your-windows-7-htpc-part-i/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n   Part 2 - Setting up Software &amp; Software Player:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.mediasmartserver.net/2011/06/30/guide-setting-up-lav-filters-mpc-hc-for-all-your-splitter-and-audio-needs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.mediasmartserver.net/2011/06/30/guide-setting-up-lav-filters-mpc-hc-for-all-your-splitter-and-audio-needs&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n2) So how can I watch your not cropped x264 rip in the so-called 2.35:1 \n   Anamorphic/Letterbox image, mate?\n\n   First, I'm not any special expert on this aspect ratio thing regarding\n   technicalities about anamorphic lenses or how a pro DP obtains the 2.35:1 \n   aspect ratio. If you want real expertise on the matter then use your powerful\n   friend Google. What really matters here is that the movie is shown in the \n   correct aspect ratio on the telly! My English is second language so bear with\n   me.  \n    \n   Ok second, we have Film Aspect Ratio = Letterbox, CinemaScope, Panavision \n   etc. = 2.35:1, 1.85:1, 1.78:1, 1.66:1, 1.33:1 ect. Film Aspect Ratio is the\n   ratio of the width of the visible area of the video/film frame to the height of\n   the visible area.\n\n   Then there's the &quot;black bars&quot;. In reality, these &quot;black bars&quot; are actually\n   unused areas of the image. These areas are black to allow for better contrast.\n   The wrongly called &quot;black bars&quot; is in fact part of the image! So if any part of\n   the black unused areas is cropped/cut of the image then the original\n   aspect/scope/letterbox ratio is lost! For ever!\n\n   And then we have Encoding Aspect Ratio. For example full-resolution 2.35:1\n   anamorphic aspect ratio encoding is 2538x1080. Blu-Ray discs is 16:9 (1.85:1)  \n   (1920x1080) aspect ratio encoded. But the original Film Aspect Ratio is still\n   2.35:1 anamorphic/letterbox scope or 1.85:1 widescreen or what ever\n   film aspect ratio. All depending on what film aspect ratio/framing the Director\n   has chosen to use.\n  \n   So you have to differentiate between the two.\n\n   Third, Yes I know that a Blu-Ray player cannot playback anamorphic/letterbox\n   material (Film Aspect Ratio and Encoding Aspect Ratio) like the DVD player\n   could, but the anamorphic/letterbox scope, as mentioned above, is still in the\n   transfer/encode, so for this to work you have to rip the Blu-Ray disc to PC,\n   and play it back anamorphic/letterbox from there (Film Aspect Ratio). Or just\n   grab one of Grym's uncropped x264 rips and use that for anamorphic/letterbox\n   playback from PC. Let's move on with the how's and do's of showing a correct\n   2.35:1 anamorphic/letterbox aspect ratio shot image on your 16:9 tv screen. \n\n   You can watch the movie in original 2.35:1 anamorphic/letterbox scope,\n   like you do in the theater, by setting the aspect ratio in your software player\n   to 2.35:1. Aka Panavision, Cinemascope, Metrovision ect (anamorphic/letterbox)\n   \n   Example: \n\n   Start up MPC-HC. Open a 2.35:1 Grym mkv encode or retail BD 2.35:1 m2ts file in\n   MPC-HC. Right click in center of MPC-HC screen. Choose 'Video Frame'. \n   Choose 'Override Aspect Ratio'. Choose '235:100' (2.35:1). A lot of software\n   players has a aspect ratio setup more or less like this, so with a tiny bit of\n   effort anyone should be able.\n\n   ---    \n   \n   Display aspect ratio setting on your 16:9 flat screen you set to 1:1 pixel \n   mapping or whatever the name is on your telly. On my own Pioneer Kuro LX5090H  \n   16:9 flat tv it's called 'Dot by Dot'.\n\n   If set correct then the image on your 16:9 flat screen should look something\n   like the screen croppings on these pictures/images: \n\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://someimage.com/Q2le&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://someimage.com/Q2le&lt;/a&gt;\n\n   You got image/screen cropping like on the pictures? \n   Now then please search 'Anamorphic Widescreen' in Youtube for more video\n   reference.\n   \n   Ok, now try doing same playback procedure with a cropped so-called &quot;2.35:1&quot;\n   1920x800 rip. 1920x800 cannot be 2.35:1 on a tv screen. It's impossible!\n   On a correct set tv screen it get's stretched to 1.85:1, because part of the \n   black areas are cropped of.\n\n   ---\n   \n   If you want to watch 1.85:1 aspect ratio movies in the correct aspect ratio\n   you then set the aspect ratio to 2.35:1, as well, and the image will have the\n   &quot;small&quot; black bars.\n\n   ---\n\n   Aspect ratios on 16:9 flat tv (Display aspect ratio setting on tv set to 1:1\n   pixel mapping and resolution is 1080p):\n\n   1.33:1 - Black bars on all sides of image (4:3) - Aka 1.37:1 Academy Standard\n            Image: &lt;a href=&quot; http://bayimg.com/NaOPKaAfd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://bayimg.com/NaOPKaAfd&lt;/a&gt;\n   \n   1.66:1 - Black bars on all sides of image (Small L+R) - Movies\n            Image: &lt;a href=&quot; http://bayimg.com/eAoNkaaFm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://bayimg.com/eAoNkaaFm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n   1.78:1 - Full screen.
