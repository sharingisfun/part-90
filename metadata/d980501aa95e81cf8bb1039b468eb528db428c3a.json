The series follows the exploits of the Anti-Corruption (Internal Affairs) department of the London Police Force. In each season we learn of a corrupt officer (bent copper) and each episode builds the case and the suspense to its end. In season two Keely Hawes is exceptional in her guest role. This series will appeal to fans of The Fall, Rebus and The Wire. It's also a great way to brush up on your British slang. Cheers, love","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d980501aa95e81cf8bb1039b468eb528db428c3a","amp;dn":"Line+of+Duty+Seasons+1+and+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d980501aa95e81cf8bb1039b468eb528db428c3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,128,80,26,169,94,129,207,139,177,3,155,70,142,181,40,219,66,140,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
