It has a higher x-height than the Grotesque version and is optimized for long texts, small sizes and screens. This sans serif type family of six weights plus matching italics was designed by Hannes von DÃƒÂ¶hren in 2012.\n\nInfluenced by the geometric-style sans serif faces that were popular during the 1920s and 30s, the fonts are based on geometric forms that have been optically corrected for better legibility. Brandon Text has a functional look with a warm touch and works perfectly together with Brandon Grotesque. It is manually hinted and optimized for screens, so it will be a good choice for Websites, eBooks or Apps.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:993698c79b88c8489b26752ea599934586cb1b4f","amp;dn":"BrandonText+Font+Family","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"993698c79b88c8489b26752ea599934586cb1b4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,54,152,199,155,136,200,72,155,38,117,46,165,153,147,69,134,203,27,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
