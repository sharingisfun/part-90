He emerges into a world of about 60 teen boys who have learned to survive in a completely enclosed environment, subsisting on their own agriculture and supplies. A new boy arrives every 30 days. The original group has been in &quot;The Glade&quot; for two years, trying to find a way to escape through the Maze that surrounds their living space. They have begun to give up hope. Then a comatose girl arrives with a strange note, and their world begins to change. There are some great, fast-paced action scenes, particularly those involving the nightmarish Grievers who plague the boys","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:480ac3a97a1257665bcd5707878b856008f270ab","amp;dn":"The+Maze+Runner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"480ac3a97a1257665bcd5707878b856008f270ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,10,195,169,122,18,87,102,91,205,87,7,135,139,133,96,8,242,112,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
