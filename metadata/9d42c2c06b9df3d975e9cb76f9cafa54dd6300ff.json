The movie, which captures the original band lineup in the middle of the legendary 1973 Billion Dollar Babies Tour, has never before available on Been Home video or DVD. \n Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Shout! Factory is proud to present the original cut of the film (including skits featuring the band) which was given a very limited theatrical run-mostly at midnight screenings-in the mid-'70s. This is the early cut, predating the Hollywood version. Now available for the first time since the theatrical release, Good To See You Again, Alice Cooper boasts a new high-definition film transfer as well as a new Surround Sound mix created from the 16-track master tapes, plus a multitude of extras, including movie-length commentary by Alice himself. &quot;The film that out-grosses them all&quot; -as it was originally billed-is back, looking and sounding better than ever. \n\nQuote:\n\nTracklist : \n 1.Hello, Hooray \n 2.Billion Dollar Babies \n 3.Elected \n 4.I'm Eighteen \n 5.Raped And Freezin ' \n 6.No More Mr. Nice Guy \n 7.My Stars \n 8.Unfinished Sweet \n Things 9.Sick \n 10.Dead Babies \n 11.i Love The Dead \n 12.School's Out \n My Wheels 13.Under \n 14.And A studio performance of The Lady Is A Tramp Bonus :  Audio Commentary by Alice Cooper  Anamorphic Widescreen &amp; 5.1 Surround Sound  &quot;Play Concert only&quot; viewing option  Unfinished Sweet (Uncensored Edit) (480p, 3:57)  Original Theatrical Trailer (480p, 3:15)  Poster Gallery with Original Promotional Material (480p, 2:57 )  Deleted Scene and Outtakes (480p, two o'clock)  Band Biographies  DVD Easter Eggs\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071572&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071572&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nQuality : Blu-ray \nformat : BDMV \nVideo codec : VC-1 \nAudio codec : DTS, PCM \nVideo : VC-1 17951 kbps 1920 * 1080p / 23,976 fps / 16: 9 / Advanced Profile 3 \nAudio # 1 : English DTS-HD MA 5.1 / 48 kHz / 4704 kbps / 24-bit (DTS Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1509 kbps / 24-bit) \nAudio # 2 : English LPCM Audio / 2.0 / 48 kHz / 2304 kbps / 24-bit \nAudio # 3 : English LPCM Audio / 2.0 / 48 kHz / 2304 kbps / 24-bit (Commentary by Alice Cooper)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d42c2c06b9df3d975e9cb76f9cafa54dd6300ff","amp;dn":"Good+To+See+You+Again-+Alice+Cooper-+BluRay+1973","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d42c2c06b9df3d975e9cb76f9cafa54dd6300ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,66,194,192,107,157,243,217,117,233,203,118,249,202,250,84,221,99,0,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
