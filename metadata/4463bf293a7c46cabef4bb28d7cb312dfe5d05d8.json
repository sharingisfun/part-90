Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\n\nGuest: Lionel\n\nEpisode 115: TACS is back and today's show begins by dissecting last night's lackluster Oscar's, we watch a news clip &quot;reporting&quot; on Lady Gaga's performance, one of Pawel Pawlikowski's long speech, talk about what a creep John Travolta is, and hear from some callers. Lionel (@LionelMedia) then joins Ant at the poker table to talk about how people aren't just &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot; anymore, the change in the media's message due to competition, social media altering daily life, privacy being a thing of the past, and how American's are praised when they agree and labeled when they don't. They also discuss immunization, the stupidity of hashtags, once powerful pictures losing their value, hate crimes, the lack of being able to contextualize, being held to bullshit standards, people's beliefs in things due to hearsay, and distractions of pettiness taking over. Lionel tells us his heroes, they converse about supply and demand, viral videos, live tweeting, being hypocritical, buying Twitter followers, &quot;shock jocks&quot;Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ and we find out the guys share a love for Joe Rogan. We're then given a bit of OT with chats on the death penalty, Indians, feminism making a comeback, plastic surgery, decriminalizing drugs, alcohol reform, basically having to get permission to live your life, guns and needing better representation when it comes to spokespeople, the outlets people now use as news sources, and Lionel expresses his obsession with death.\n\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\n\n\n\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\n\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4463bf293a7c46cabef4bb28d7cb312dfe5d05d8","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-02-23+MP4+MP3+combo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4463bf293a7c46cabef4bb28d7cb312dfe5d05d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,99,191,41,58,124,70,202,190,244,187,40,215,203,49,45,254,93,5,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
