Unfolding in lonely places such as bookshops and hotel bars, Dave Boyle's moody thriller uncovers exhilarating new takes on genre conventions. Consequently, it's an alluring l'homme fatal who supplies Aki with the breadcrumb trail of clues that entices her into a labyrinthine plot of sinister dealings. In turn, the aging sheriff who should rightfully be riding to her rescue proves to be equally out of his depth. The game is afoot, the chase is exhilarating and the stakes are perilously high in this inspired neo-noir.\n\nDirector: Dave Boyle\n\nWriters: Dave Boyle, Joel Clark, Michael Lerman\n\nActors: Ayako Fujitani, Pepe Serna, Kazuki Kitamura\n\nGenre: Thriller\n\nRun Time: 1 hour 51 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b941aeaa666b23c4a6e3a8e1584540a67303e8e2","amp;dn":"Man+from+Reno.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b941aeaa666b23c4a6e3a8e1584540a67303e8e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,65,174,170,102,107,35,196,166,227,168,225,88,69,64,166,115,3,232,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
