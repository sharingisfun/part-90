Unless reinforcements can be brought from England, \nthe depleted South Essex will be disbanded, their troops scattered throughout the \narmy. Determined not to see his regiment die, Sharpe returns to England and \nuncovers a nest of well-bred, high-ranking traitors, any one of whom could \nutterly destroy his career with a word, or a stroke of the pen. Sharpe is forced\n into the most desperate gamble of his life - and not even the influence of the \nPrice Regent may be enough to save him.\n\n \n\nDirected by Tom Clegg\nWritten by Eoghan Harris and Charles Wood from the novel by Bernard Cornwell\nStarring Sean Bean as Richard Sharpe and Daragh OÃƒâ€ Malley as Patrick Harper[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff1e3e77eba9e1f7f628ba968ecc8cca24105250","amp;dn":"Sharpe%27s+REGIMENT+%5B9+of+15%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff1e3e77eba9e1f7f628ba968ecc8cca24105250","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,30,62,119,235,169,225,247,246,40,186,150,142,204,140,202,36,16,82,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
