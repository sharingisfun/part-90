Although my major interest was in the fields of theology and philosophy, I spent a great deal of time reading the works of the great social philosophers. \n\nI came early to Walter RauschenbuschÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Christianity and the Social Crisis, which left an indelible imprint on my thinking by giving me a theological basis for the social concern which had already grown up in me as a result of my early experiences.* Of course there were points at which I differed with Rauschenbusch. I felt that he had fallen victim to the nineteenth-century Ã¢â‚¬Å“cult of inevitable progressÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which led him to a superficial optimism concerning manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nature. Moreover, he came perilously close to identifylng the Kingdom of God with a particular social and economic systema tendency which should never befall the Church. But in spite of these shortcomings Rauschenbusch had done a great service for the Christian Church by insisting that the gospel deals with the whole man, not only his soul but his body; not only his spiritual well-being but his material well-being. It has been my conviction ever since reading Rauschenbusch that any religion which professes to be concerned about the souls of men and is not concerned about the social and economic conditions that scar the soul, is a spiritually moribund religion only waiting for the day to be buried. It well has been said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“A religion that ends with the individual, ends.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;\n\nWalter Rauschenbush\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Rauschenbusch&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Rauschenbusch&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFour Modern Prophets: Walter Rauschenbusch, Martin Luther King Jr, Gustavo Gutierrez, Rosemary Ruether","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8b921d7e25684731bdefae1fad2a2c07367c0ad","amp;dn":"Rauschenbusch+%27Christianity.%27+Revolutionized+Seminarian+MLK+Jr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8b921d7e25684731bdefae1fad2a2c07367c0ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,185,33,215,226,86,132,115,27,222,250,225,250,210,162,192,115,103,192,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
