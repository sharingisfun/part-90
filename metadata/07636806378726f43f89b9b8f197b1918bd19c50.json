Having survived the incident in Raccoon City, as described in the previous games Resident Evil, Claire is now working for the organization &quot;Terra Saves&quot;, which is fighting bioterrorism. During the party on the occasion of receiving Claire to work in &quot;Terra Saves&quot; unknown armed groups break into the office. Forwards stun Claire Burton and Moira, who was also present at the party. Later, they both come to mind in the dark and abandoned prison. Together, they must find out who kidnapped them and what sinister purpose. Will Claire and Moira escape and find out which is why they were brought to this remote island? Plot, full of unpredictable twists and turns, players make the puzzle at every step. Heading to a remote island-prison in finding lost daughter, Barry Burton meets an entirely new character - a little girl named Natalia Korda. It has unusual abilities that allow her to feel enemies and hidden objects. Using these skills together with proven skills of a fighter Barry, players will need to switch between the two characters to survive on a mysterious island and find Moira. Barry must expend ammunition and weapons wisely, as it should be in a classic survival horror - after all the terrible enemies await him at every turn.
