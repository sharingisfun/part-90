French Roots is the story of their lives told through the food they cook--beginning with the dishes of old-world France, the couple's birthplace, and focusing on the simple, pared-down preparations of French food common in the postwar period. The story then travels to the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1970s, where Jean-Pierre was appointed executive chef at Chez Panisse when California cuisine was just emerging as a distinctive and important style, and where Denise began importing French wine. Finally, the journey follows the couple to their homes in Sonoma, California, and Bordeaux to revisit the classic dishes of the MoullÃƒÂ©s' native country and hone the forgotten skills of foraging, hunting, and preserving. \n\nExquisitely written, with recipes that are innovative and timeless, insights on cooking and thinking like a chef, and an insider's guide to the wines of Bordeaux, French Roots is much more than a cookbook--it's a guide to living the good life.\n\n\nBy Jean-Pierre MoullÃƒÂ©, Denise Lurton MoullÃƒÂ©\nPublished by Ten Speed Press in 2014\nEPUB, Retail, 272 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1d098a2c862c88ed3a8190fc48fa944af79dcb7","amp;dn":"French+Roots+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1d098a2c862c88ed3a8190fc48fa944af79dcb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,208,152,162,200,98,200,142,211,168,25,15,196,143,169,68,175,121,220,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
