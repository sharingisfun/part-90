He has been a DJ since 1994 and produces DJ mixes as well as audiovisual art in the form of music videos along with them. His interests in life includes music from various styles and genres along with sound- and visual art in all forms and shapes, though mainly - besides abstract compositions and pop art/lowbrow - surrealism, which he finds pleasing to the mind on many levels. Nothing less, but maybe more - a question of interest.\n\nDJ Venom combines the eclectic sounds of Electronic Music with many different music genres to bring a truly unique sound to the dance floor.\n\n\nDNSK - facebook dot com/dnsksweden/\nDJ Venom - facebook dot com/DJVenom1984/\n\nMixcloud:\n\nDNSK - mixcloud dot com/daniel-asplund/\nDJ Venom - mixcloud dot com/DJVENOM30/\n\nYouTube:\n\nDNSK - youtube dot com/channel/UCPmXy2zg1H5AS0__UkNMjlw/\n\nThe Pirate Bay:\n\nDNSK - thepiratebay dot se/user/dnsk/\n\n-\n\nCONTACT:\n\nDNSK - dnsksweden at gmail dot com / #DNSK at EFNet - chat.efnet.org:9090\n\n-\n\nThank you for watching!\n\nDNSK &amp; DJ Venom","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d5708b091c0a7cf46312e5c36ffbe2764c1c022","amp;dn":"DNSK_vs_DJ_Venom-Probability_Theory-2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d5708b091c0a7cf46312e5c36ffbe2764c1c022","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,87,8,176,145,192,167,207,70,49,46,92,54,255,190,39,100,193,192,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
