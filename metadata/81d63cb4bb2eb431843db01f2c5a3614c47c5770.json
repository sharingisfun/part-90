The Grandeur reunites him with his Bowl of Fire counterparts, as well as some special collaborators like the Squirrel Nut Zippers' James Mathus. Recorded in New Orleans, the album builds on the hot jazz/Brecht vibe that Bowl of Fire pioneered on their first album Thrills, but focuses more on Bird's witty lyric","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81d63cb4bb2eb431843db01f2c5a3614c47c5770","amp;dn":"Andrew+Bird%27s+Bowl+of+Fire+-+Oh%21+The+Grandeur+%5B1999%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81d63cb4bb2eb431843db01f2c5a3614c47c5770","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,214,60,180,187,46,180,49,132,61,176,31,44,90,54,20,196,124,87,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
