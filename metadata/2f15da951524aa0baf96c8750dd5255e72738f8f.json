One party. One motto: you only live once. In the tradition of wtf and fml, a crazy story of three friends and a road trip gone wrong right.\n\nEmily and her best friends, Ana and Brandon, know it should only take half a day to get to the mountains, where the Stein twins are hosting a massive Spring Break party at their parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ mansion. The road trip should be a breeze; the driving itinerary even includes several stops along the way, the first being a bite to eat at a real, classic roadside diner.\n\nAnd thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where everything falls apart.\n\nThrow in a couple of criminals, an accidental thief, and a miniature drug lord, and suddenly the half-day trip is gonna take a little longer. Add a Chihuahua, some crazy grandparents, and a hot pool-hall boy named Chris...and maybe the journey to the party will end up being better than the party itselfÃ¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f15da951524aa0baf96c8750dd5255e72738f8f","amp;dn":"yolo+by+Sam+Jones+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f15da951524aa0baf96c8750dd5255e72738f8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,21,218,149,21,36,170,11,175,150,200,117,13,213,37,94,114,115,143,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
