The music of Volume 12, all recorded in the space of a few weeks (March/April 2002,) is as varied as the films they were written for. A touch of minimalism laces the score to Charles DennisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ film on New YorkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s East Village dance scene; haunting and childlike, the music for a documentary on outsider artist Morton Bartlett is tenderly scored for voice and cello; finally, guitarist Marc Ribot goes head to head with Chinese pipa virtuoso Min Xiao-Fen for a film on the lives of Shaolin Monks who have come to America to spread the teachings of Buddha through the martial arts. Obsession, culture clash and minimalism from the crucible of John Zorn and his circle of creative musicians. \n\nPersonnel:\nCyro Baptista: Percussion\nJennifer Charles: Voice\nTrevor Dunn: Bass\nMark Feldman: Violin\nErik Friedlander: Cello\nMarc Ribot: Guitar\nRoberto Rodriguez: Percussion\nJamie Saft: Wurlitzer Piano\nMin Xiao-Fen: Pipa\nJohn Zorn: Organ, Glass Harmonica, Wurlitzer Piano \n\n\n    &quot;Vocal Phase&quot; - 3:49\n    &quot;The Lips At Sway&quot; - 5:07\n    &quot;The Well Tuned Harmonica&quot; - 1:35\n    &quot;Dance Piece&quot; - 2:10\n    &quot;Midnight Flight&quot; - 2:12\n    &quot;Chippy Charm&quot; - 1:35\n    &quot;Shaolin Spirit&quot; - 3:01\n    &quot;Bamboo Forest&quot; - 1:24\n    &quot;Shaolin Ulysses&quot; - 2:00\n    &quot;Shaolin Bossa&quot; - 3:16\n    &quot;Travelling West&quot; - 2:43\n    &quot;Temple Song&quot; (traditional) - 2:25\n    &quot;Shaolin Family&quot; - 1:16\n    &quot;Nostalgia&quot; - 0:54\n    &quot;Shaolin Mambo&quot; - 2:57\n    &quot;Transition&quot; - 1:25\n    &quot;Shaolin Bossa&quot; (fast) - 2:22\n    &quot;Vegas&quot; - 1:03\n    &quot;Kung Fu Percussion&quot; - 1:50\n    &quot;Shaolin Spirit&quot; (duo) - 5:12\n    &quot;Shaolin Bossa Vibe&quot; - 1:54\n    &quot;Shaolin Dream&quot; - 1:43\n    &quot;Shaolin Ulysses&quot; (end titles) - 2:10\n    &quot;Family Found&quot; (vocal) - 2:33\n    &quot;Family Found&quot; (solo arco) - 1:09\n    &quot;Family Found&quot; (solo pizz) - 0:46\n    &quot;Family Found&quot; (cello) - 2:31\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f0584d2b5fee9727180468cda72ada02e99d501","amp;dn":"John+Zorn+-+Filmworks+12+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f0584d2b5fee9727180468cda72ada02e99d501","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,5,132,210,181,254,233,114,113,128,70,140,218,114,173,160,46,153,213,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
