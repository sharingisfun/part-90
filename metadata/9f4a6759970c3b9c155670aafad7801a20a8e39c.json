Habib Cobra 4.65\n\nNot going to upload Darknet as he SAYS trophy fix can delete trophy like rebug\nNOT TRUE TESTED JUST ANOTHER CFW\n\nHabib Cobra works perfect with irisman\nFor Non_BC(PS3) cobra is useless unless multiman release 4.65 multiman probs aint gonna happen.\n\nThis CFW has safe feature when toggling cobra to non and changing ps2 cobra emu to normal (only to be used with BC PS3 i presume) anyway good safe working I tried changing disless payload blueray W and Without via irisman loading ps2 disc dont work\nI have Non_BC(PS3)\n\nCan't send ps2 iso to ps2emu as not enough space.\nWill not recognise ps2 iso from games folder as is a ps2 game not ps3\nMaybe irisman will release a mounting option like multiman for ps2 disc to iso mount and load as iso\n\nSo no go for PS3_BC(PS3) if you do brick its safe when changing payload etc as this cfw of habib has safe switch. When light flashes red just click the power on/off button.\nThen click power on/off button and ps3 should divert back to normal safest Cobra CFW\nout of all.\nDon't forget becare of bricking \nI BRICKKKED MY FIRST PS3 with other habib CFWS with cobra\nTHEY ARE CRAP\n\nSO USE THIS OR 4.46 habib cobra but if want to use new CFW\nTHIS IS BEST BET\nPLus has cobra toggle built in install from install package folder\n\nENJOY AND COMMENT \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f4a6759970c3b9c155670aafad7801a20a8e39c","amp;dn":"%5BPS3%5D+Habib+Cobra+4.65+CFW+v1.01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f4a6759970c3b9c155670aafad7801a20a8e39c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,74,103,89,151,12,59,156,21,86,112,170,250,215,128,26,32,168,227,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
