However, for years she has harboured a secret crush for the eye-droppingly handsome local football hero who saddly doesn't even realise she exists.\n\nAs if Eve's love-life couldn't get any worse, Linda, a larger than life, blonde bombshell from the city sweeps into town, swooping up all the fellas in her path. As the local guys go crazy for Linda, Eve's plans to bag her football hero go seriously awry.\n(promotional text)\n\nStars: Marla Sokoloff, Barry Watson, Monika Schnarre, Jennifer Tilly\n\nProduced: 2004\nRuntime: 83 minutes\nDirector: Vic Sarin\n\nKeywords: Lesbian, Comedy, Romance\n\nFile: Love.on.the.Side.P2P.Xvid.mp3-CAFE.avi\nVideo: Xvid, 700x572 (16:9), 25 f/s, Advanced Simple@L4, 1175 Kb/s\nAudio: English, mp3, 2.0 CH, 48 kHz SR, 128 Kb/s\nSubtitles: None\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://x-ite.me&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://x-ite.me&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d91c97a74d1d14928249237e37ada024ad1459be","amp;dn":"Love+on+the+side+%282004%29+-+Lesbian+comedy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d91c97a74d1d14928249237e37ada024ad1459be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,28,151,167,77,29,20,146,130,73,35,126,55,173,160,36,173,20,89,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
