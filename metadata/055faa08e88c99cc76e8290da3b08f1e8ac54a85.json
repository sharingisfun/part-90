It contains His actual words.\n\nThe Bible is God's book. He gave it by inspiration. The words of scripture are God's words. But not only did God give His words to man, He also promised to preserve them... for specific reasons. They are shown to us in the Bible. We believe that we have the perfectly preserved words of God in our 1611 King James Bible, also called the Authorized Version or KJV.\n\n\n\n\nkjv Audio Bible\n\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://c569624.r24.cf2.rackcdn.com/zip/kjv.zip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://c569624.r24.cf2.rackcdn.com/zip/kjv.zip&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:055faa08e88c99cc76e8290da3b08f1e8ac54a85","amp;dn":"1611++King+James+Version+KJV+Bible+%5B+PDF%2C+Epub%2C+Mobi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"055faa08e88c99cc76e8290da3b08f1e8ac54a85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,95,170,8,232,140,153,204,118,232,41,13,163,176,143,30,138,197,74,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
