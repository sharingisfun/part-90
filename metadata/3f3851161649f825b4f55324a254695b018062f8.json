Again, if your system already has it,\nyou don't need to install it.\n\nIf you don't know if your system has VC8 and VC2008 libraries installed, don't copy\nfolder &quot;Microsoft.VC80.CRT&quot; neither run &quot;vcredist_x86.exe&quot;. Then, try to encode\nwith AAC (Apple) and AAC (Winamp FhG). If any of the encodes fail, you'll know you\nneed one or both libraries. If AAC (Apple) fails, you need folder\n&quot;Microsoft.VC80.CRT&quot;. If AAC (Winamp FhG) fails, you need to run vcredist_x86.exe.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis pack lets you use all the encoder presets bundled with foobar2000.\nCopy all the files in &quot;Tools&quot; folder to a folder of your choice.\nIn my case, I created a &quot;tools&quot; folder directly below the foobar2000 program folder.\nYou don't need any other files other than the ones provided here.\n\nWhen you perform the first conversion (no matter which encoder you use),\nfoobar2000 will prompt you for the location of the encoder executable.\nPoint to the folder where you stored the files. That's it!\n\nThe following encoders are provided:\n\nAAC (Apple)\nAAC (FDK)\nAAC (Nero)\nAAC (Winamp FhG)\nApple Lossless (ALAC)\nFLAC\nMP3 (LAME)\nMusepack\nOgg Vorbis\nOpus\nWavPack\n\nNote that, to use AAC (Apple) or ALAC you DON'T need to install iTunes or QuickTime.\nAll necessary files are provided. Similarly, you DON'T need to install Winamp in\norder to use AAC (Winamp FhG).\n\nList of files:\n\nMicrosoft.VC80.CRTMicrosoft.VC80.CRT.manifest\nMicrosoft.VC80.CRTmsvcp80.dll\nMicrosoft.VC80.CRTmsvcr80.dll\nASL.dll\nCoreAudioToolbox.dll\nCoreFoundation.dll\nenc_fhgaac.dll\nfdkaac.exe\nfhgaacenc.exe\nflac.exe\nicudt46.dll\nicuin40.dll\nicuuc40.dll\nlame.exe\nlibdispatch.dll\nlibicuin.dll\nlibicuuc.dll\nlibmp4v2.dll\nmpcenc.exe\nneroAacEnc.exe\nnsutil.dll\nobjc.dll\noggenc2.exe\nopusenc.exe\npthreadVC2.dll\nqaac.exe\nwavpack.exe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f3851161649f825b4f55324a254695b018062f8","amp;dn":"foobar2000+Complete+Encoder+Pack+v2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f3851161649f825b4f55324a254695b018062f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,56,81,22,22,73,248,37,180,245,83,36,162,84,105,91,1,128,98,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
