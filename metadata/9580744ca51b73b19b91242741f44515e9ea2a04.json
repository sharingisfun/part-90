However, I really liked the intros that Season 1 and 2 had, so I decided to create my own version of that using the DVDRs.\n\nThe DVDRs and the WEBRips are actually 29.970 fps, so deinterlaced the DVDRs instead of detelecining them.\n\nI obviously had to reencode the video for Episodes 1-12, this was done @ CRF 19 and it looks fine in my opinion. I also had to reencode the audio, I did this for all episodes because HC-AAC isn't recognised by some players - this was done with libfkd_aac at vbr 5 so there shouldn't be any noticable quality loss.\n\nEpisode 13-18 have the only original video files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9580744ca51b73b19b91242741f44515e9ea2a04","amp;dn":"South.Park.S02.WITH.INTROS.720p.WEBRip.H.264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9580744ca51b73b19b91242741f44515e9ea2a04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,128,116,76,165,27,115,177,155,145,36,39,65,244,69,21,233,234,42,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
