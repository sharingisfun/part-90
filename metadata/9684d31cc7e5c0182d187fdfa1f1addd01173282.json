Speculation only though!\nI personally enjoy these albums and in some cases I like these\ncover versions as much as the originals. \nThe condition isn't the best on some tracks as the LP\nwas well used when I found it.\nI provided the original artist name beside the tracks for context.\nOne neat thing is to hear a cover version of 'Sounds of Silence' \nin the PRE beat version with just acoustic guitars and Stand Up Bass\nand pretty nice vocals and Michelle getting a soul treatment","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9684d31cc7e5c0182d187fdfa1f1addd01173282","amp;dn":"HITS+A+GO+GO-ARC-1966-CANADA-HP37+MONO-24K+ALAC-freQazoidiac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9684d31cc7e5c0182d187fdfa1f1addd01173282","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,132,211,28,199,229,192,24,45,24,127,223,161,241,173,221,1,23,50,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
