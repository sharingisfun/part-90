This is a tale of feminine maturation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ of Savannah's metamorphosis from ingÃƒÂ©nue to woman-of-the-world. Nibbling roasted duck tongues in China and being stranded in Mongolia's Gobi Desert are just two experiences that contribute to Savannah's exploration of new cultures and to the process of adapting to the world around her.\n\nBackpacks and Bra straps - Savannah Grace\n\nSavannah GraceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best selling, award winning saga of her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s four-year-long backpacking adventure continues. &quot;Backpacks and Bra Straps&quot; picks up where &quot;I Grew My Boobs in China&quot; leaves off, offering insights into how family dynamics are affected by such intensive togetherness as well as a candid, intriguing look at world-wide travel and the camaraderie of the backpacking community, told from a perceptive young womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s viewpoint. This second installment of her Sihpromatum series takes us to Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, through Western China and Tibet, and finally, to watch the sun rise over Mount Everest in Nepal.
