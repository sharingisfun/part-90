Like an extended family, the Bombay railway provides an unfailing lifeline \nto the city. This series follows the hope and dreams of some the people who work \nfor the railway.\n\nHans Dev Sharma is a senior operations clerk. He works in the timetabling department, \nwhich schedules over 2,000 trains a day - under its cultural quota Hans Dev Sharma \nwas talent-spotted as an exceptional actor and dancer and the railways offered him a \njob. Hans is living the Bollywood dream, with Bombay Railways as his life and his \nstage. But will he get his big break?\n\nJagdish Paul Raj was born in Bombay and is as ambitious as the city he lives in. The \nson of a railway catering officer, Jagdish, like his father, always had an interest in food \nbut none in the railway. He graduated in politics and economics and became a fully \nqualified chef. Now 31, he is running a successful catering business on the train to \nGoa. He is tendered for more trains, but will he be successful?\n\nMumtaz Kazi is Indian Railways' first fully-qualified female train driver and has driven \ntrains all over India. Mumtaz was brought up in a traditional Muslim family - a railway \nfamily. Now her father has retired and her immediate family live in Canada - Mumtaz \nis the only member left in Bombay. It will be Mumtaz's responsibility to find a wife \nfor her brother, to get him married and back to Canada in just eight weeks. Can she \ndo it and still drive the train ?\n\n \n\n                                 Enjoy!\n\n  Greetings To: aAF BARGE BiA FTP FoV HAGGiS RiVER SomeTV TASTETV WATERS \n\n     We are currently looking for:\n     * US/UK cappers with HDTV/PDTV/DSR feed (1Mbit+ Upload Speed)\n     * Legit .EU 100MBit+ sites to affil (no rented/colo/leaseweb)\n\n               E-mail enquires to","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7c7cfbae0d4fe21311da7cf11925bafc18b92a3","amp;dn":"Bombay.Railway.Part.2.Dreams.PDTV.x264-C4TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7c7cfbae0d4fe21311da7cf11925bafc18b92a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,199,207,186,224,212,254,33,49,29,167,207,17,146,91,175,193,139,146,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
