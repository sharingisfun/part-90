When I looked to see, if any more audiobooks in this series had been uploaded, I could not find the old torrent anymore, so I am reuploading this series.  The series is at 80 kbps,and sounds good.  I have put the series in 4 .m4b files.  I had to brake up the series because if, you make a .m4b file larger than 3.99 GB the file will not play to the end.  I like to listen to series with as little number of files as possible, so I do not have to switch from file to file so much.  I think .m4b is the best format to listen to audiobooks because it saves where you are at in the book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee98516b0e3e009b9fdb2946338b5c3a8761f0cf","amp;dn":"Suzanne+Brockmann+-+Troubleshooters+1-16","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee98516b0e3e009b9fdb2946338b5c3a8761f0cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,152,81,107,14,62,0,155,159,219,41,70,51,139,92,58,135,97,240,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
