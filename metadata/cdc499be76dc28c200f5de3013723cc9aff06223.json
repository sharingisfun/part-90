His father played a number of instruments, and made certain that Nat and his three brothers were all accomplished musicians at an early age\n\nShilkret was a child prodigy, touring the country with the New York Boys' Orchestra from the ages of seven to thirteen as their clarinet soloist. From his late teens to mid-twenties he was a clarinetist in the best New York music organizations, including the New York Philharmonic Society (under Vassily Safanov and Gustav Mahler), the New York Symphony Orchestra, the Metropolitan Opera House Orchestra, the Russian Symphony Orchestra, Victor Herbert's Orchestra, Arnold Volpe's Orchestra, Sousa's Grand Concert Band, Arthur Pryor's Band, and Edwin Franko Goldman's Band. He was also a rehearsal pianist for Walter Damrosch, playing for stars that included dancer Isadora Duncan.\n\nHe joined the Foreign Department of the Victor Talking Machine Company (later RCA Victor) around 1915, and soon was made manager of the department.\n\nIn 1926 he became &quot;director of light music&quot; for Victor. He made thousands of recordings, possibly more than anyone in recording history. His son Arthur estimated the sales of these records was of the order of 50 million copies.\n\nHe was also one of radio's earliest stars, estimating that he made over 3000 broadcasts between 1925 and 1941, including being the conductor for The Eveready Hour, regarded as the first major commercial broadcast and the first major variety show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdc499be76dc28c200f5de3013723cc9aff06223","amp;dn":"Nat+Shilkret+-+Dancing+With+Tears+In+My+Eyes+%281926-30%29+AVS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdc499be76dc28c200f5de3013723cc9aff06223","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,196,153,190,118,220,40,194,0,245,222,48,19,114,60,201,175,240,98,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
