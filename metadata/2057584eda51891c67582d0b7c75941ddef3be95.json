Turner (1775-1851). Profoundly affected by the death of his father, loved by a housekeeper he takes for granted and occasionally exploits sexually, he forms a close relationship with a seaside landlady with whom he eventually lives incognito in Chelsea, where he dies. Throughout this, he travels, paints, stays with the country aristocracy, visits brothels, is a popular if anarchic member of the Royal Academy of Arts, has himself strapped to the mast of a ship so that he can paint a snowstorm, and is both celebrated and reviled by the public and by royalty. \n\nRatings: 7.0/10 from 7,477 users  \n\nDirector: Mike Leigh\n\nStars: Timothy Spall, Paul Jesson, Dorothy Atkinson\n\nGenre: Biography, Drama, History\n\nVideo: MPEG-4 x264 @ 2005Kbps | Aspect: 1920 x 800 @ 23.976fps\n\nAudio: AAC 128Kbps 2ch | Language: English\n\nLength: 2h 30min | Size: 2240Mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2057584eda51891c67582d0b7c75941ddef3be95","amp;dn":"Mr+Turner+%282014%29+BRRip+1080p+-+MrKickASS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2057584eda51891c67582d0b7c75941ddef3be95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,87,88,78,218,81,137,28,103,88,45,11,124,117,148,29,222,243,190,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
