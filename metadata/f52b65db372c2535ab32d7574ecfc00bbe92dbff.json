A naive man with lethal narcotics hidden in his stomach is detained by Australian Federal Police. Alone and afraid, 'the Mule' makes a desperate choice; to defy his bodily functions and withhold the evidence, literally. And by doing so becomes a 'human time bomb'; dragging cops, criminals and concerned family into his impossible escapade. Inspired by true events, THE MULE is directed by Angus Sampson and Tony Mahony, with a darkly comic screenplay by Sampson, Leigh Whannell (Saw, Insidious) and Jaime Browne.\n\nMovie Title: The Mule (2014)\nDirector: Tony Mahony, Angus Sampson\nStars: Hugo Weaving, Angus Sampson, Leigh Whannell, Ewen Leslie\nRelease Date: 21 Nov 2014\nGenres: Crime\nFormat: MatRoska (Mkv)\nFile Size: 900MB\nResolution: 1280x536\nRuntime: 01:42:37\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: English [Softcoded] - Muxed\nEncoder: MkvCage (MC) Team\nSource: 720p.BluRay.X264-CADAVER\n\n\nFOR MEDIAINFO &amp; SCREENSHOTS:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mkvcage.com/mule-2014-720p-brrip-900mb/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mkvcage.com/mule-2014-720p-brrip-900mb/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f52b65db372c2535ab32d7574ecfc00bbe92dbff","amp;dn":"The.Mule.2014.720p.BRRip.900MB.Mkvcage.com.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f52b65db372c2535ab32d7574ecfc00bbe92dbff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,43,101,219,55,44,37,53,171,50,215,87,78,207,192,11,190,146,219,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
