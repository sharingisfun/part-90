I close my calculator and place that, too, carefully into the calculator slot. Inserting my pens and my pencils, I slide the silver zipper around my bag to close it.\n6:54 p.m.\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m in my bathroom. I stare at my face. My ocean blue eyes. My dirty blonde hair. My tan skin (acquired from this summer in Cabo, Mexico). I splash water on my face.\n6:56 p.m.\nMy heartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s starting to beat faster. It always does at this time. I try to control my breathing as I continue to organize the already organized room. I feel my eyelids beginning to droop.\n6:58 p.m.\nMy heart beat slows. I crawl into my bed and pull the covers tightly around me, caging my body so it couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t flee. I breathe out of my mouth as my lids droop down, down, down.\n6:59 p.m.\nEverything goes black.\n\n\nCameron is suffering from &quot;schizophrenia&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€or so they thought. By day he's a regular boy with good grades and many friends, but come 6:59 p.m., he becomes a whole different person: Cam. He's now a part of a group of powerful, supernatural human beings called the Gray Eyes, forced to do dangerous missions and answer to the king of all Gray Eyes. Fortunately, Cam can only make his appearance after 7:00 p.m. But, unfortunately, both sides of this one body have their friends, families and their love, Olive Ramos, completely confused. A confusion that could not only damage relationships, ruin lives, and drive others mad, but could also get them killed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1b2dd3369249687314cbf81c5e5123736ab4cfd","amp;dn":"6-59+by+Nonye+and+Kelechi+Acholonu+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1b2dd3369249687314cbf81c5e5123736ab4cfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,178,221,51,105,36,150,135,49,76,191,129,197,229,18,55,54,171,76,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
