Tom Chandler learns that the destroyer will be in the best possible place to save humanity from extinction. A virus has wiped out more than half the population since the ship embarked, and despite orders to return, Chandler -- believing home is now a shadow of itself -- decides the safest place to develop a vaccine is at sea. That task falls mainly to virologist Dr. Rachel Scott, a civilian originally assigned to the Nathan James to study birds. &quot;The Last Ship&quot; is based on a novel by William Brinkley and is executive-produced by filmmaker Michael Bay.\n\nTheir mission is simple: Find a cure. Stop the virus. Save the world.\n\nTrailer:addtional clips at...\n\nEric Dane....................as Commander Tom Chandler\nRhona Mitra.................as Rachel Scott, a paleomicrobiologist\nAdam Baldwin..............as Mike Slattery, the ship's second-in-command\nTracy Middendorf..........as Darien Chandler, the captain's wife\nJocko Sims...................as Dalton Burk\nCharles Parnell.............as Hugh Jeter, the ship's command master chief\nChristina Elmore...........as Lieutenant Alisha Granderson\nMichaela McManus........as Lieutenant Jackie Makena\nSam Spruell.................as Quincy Tophet, a paleomicrobiologist\nTravis Van Winkle.........as Danny Green, leader of a SEAL team\n\nGeneral Information\n\nStatus: Airing Season 1\nSeries Premiere: June 22, 2014\nClassification: Scripted\nGenre: Action | Adventure | Drama | Thriller\nNetwork: TNT (USA)\nAirs: Sundays at 09:00 pm\nRuntime: 60 Minutes\n\nSeason 1 -- 10 Episodes\n\n1x01 -- Jun 22, 2014 -- Pilot: Phase Six\n1x02 -- Jun 29, 2014 -- Welcome to Gitmo\n1x03 -- Jul 06, 2014 -- Dead Reckoning\n1x04 -- Jul 13, 2014 -- We'll Get There\n1x05 -- Jul 20, 2014 -- El Toro\n1x06 -- Jul 27, 2014 -- Lockdown\n1x07 -- Aug 03, 2014 -- SOS\n1x08 -- Aug 10, 2014 -- Two Sailors Walk into a Bar\n1x09 -- Aug 17, 2014 -- Trials\n1x10 -- Aug 24, 2014 -- No Place Like Home\n\nJuly 18, 2014, the series was renewed for a 13-episode second season.\n\nAdditional Show Information\n\nTVRage............. http://www.tvrage.com/shows/id-33158\nWikipedia.......... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Ship_(TV_series)\nZap2it............... http://www.zap2it.com/tv/the-last-ship/episodes/SH017417270000\nTheFutonCritic.... http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/last-ship/listings/\nIMDB................. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2402207/\nTwitter..............\nFacebook...........\nOfficial Website... http://www.thelastshiptnt.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4600c42fc2187cef6e9ae92e9b9ff14f9cc56f93","amp;dn":"The.Last.Ship.S01E01-E10.Multisub.720p.HDTV.X264+-Holmlinde","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4600c42fc2187cef6e9ae92e9b9ff14f9cc56f93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,0,196,47,194,24,124,239,110,154,233,46,155,159,241,79,156,197,111,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
