Each year we discover and play new music from both established artists &amp; bands and talented newcomers. We invite them inot our studios to perform live on-air, giving us this rare compilation of music. Often these new artists become big names, and we are proud to have been the first to introduce them to our listeners through these Studio C performances. We hope you enjoy this year's Cities' Sampler. We thank you for you listenership and continued support of this project that helps so many in our community.\n\nÃ‚Â© 2002 KTCZ 97.1 FM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9ae77bf85c69f4cc75241dce5a1315a6989210d","amp;dn":"VA+-+Cities%27+97+Sampler+Volume+14+%282002%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9ae77bf85c69f4cc75241dce5a1315a6989210d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,174,119,191,133,198,159,76,199,82,65,220,229,161,49,90,105,137,33,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
