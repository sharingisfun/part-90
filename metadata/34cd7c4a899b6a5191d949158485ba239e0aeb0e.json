The identifiers are:\n\n1. Mine: v=ezQWB8bsRR8\n2. Theirs: v=1oE9CtmSGSE\n\nThirdly, you can listen to the AVI of the song prior to my upload which is contained within this torrent and which is better in audio quality than either of the above.\n\n- user101966","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34cd7c4a899b6a5191d949158485ba239e0aeb0e","amp;dn":"In.Answer.To.Comment.On.11643461","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34cd7c4a899b6a5191d949158485ba239e0aeb0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,205,124,74,137,155,106,81,145,217,73,21,132,133,186,35,158,10,235,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
