Recorded during the artist's 1984 European Tour, most of the album was recorded at Wembley Stadium on 7 July, but &quot;License to Kill&quot; and &quot;Tombstone Blues&quot; come from St James' Park, Newcastle on 5 July, and &quot;I and I&quot; and &quot;Girl from the North Country&quot; were recorded at Slane Castle, Ireland on 8 July. \n\nProduced by Glyn Johns, it features Mick Taylor (formerly of the Rolling Stones) on lead guitar, Ian McLagan (formerly of the Faces) on keyboards, and a guest appearance from Carlos Santana. The performances on Real Live were recorded in support of his successful Infidels album. While Infidels was hailed as a &quot;return to musical form&quot; (as described by Kurt Loder in Rolling Stone magazine), critical reception for Real Live was generally mixed.\n\nReleased in December to capitalize on the Christmas shopping season, Real Live still sold in disappointing numbers, reaching a then-career low of #115 in the US and #54 in the UK.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:07\n    &quot;Maggie's Farm&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:54\n    &quot;I and I&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:00\n    &quot;License to Kill&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:26\n    &quot;It Ain't Me, Babe&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:17\n    &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:54\n    &quot;Masters of War&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:35\n    &quot;Ballad of a Thin Man&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:17\n    &quot;Girl from the North Country&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:25\n    &quot;Tombstone Blues&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:32\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n\n    Bob Dylan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, harmonica, keyboards, vocals\n\n    Colin Allen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n    Ian McLagan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards\n    Carlos Santana Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar on &quot;Tombstone Blues&quot;\n    Gregg Sutton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar\n    Mick Taylor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:764f43eff0ad96e191bb82d52360f031dc46f5b4","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Real+Live+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"764f43eff0ad96e191bb82d52360f031dc46f5b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,79,67,239,240,173,150,225,145,187,130,213,35,96,240,49,220,70,245,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
