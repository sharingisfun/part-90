USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!\nIf you don't know what &quot;root&quot; is, then DON'T install this app. It won't work without root!\n\nRepetiTouch for AndroidÃ¢â€žÂ¢ - Record touch events and replay them!\nRepetiTouch enables easy recording and replaying of touch events. Simply record and replay your touchscreen input!\nJust click the record button and start recording - the panel will stay on top almost all the time! When you're done, you can replay your touch events as easily. To access the menu, click on the star.\nBut beware, replaying touch events can fail or cause unwanted effects for many reasons, e.g., if replay is started at a different device state than during the record or if during replay a popup is shown or something else is different than during record. Thus, always monitor your device during replay! Replay automatically stops if you're touching the screen, pressing the power button or on a phone call. Also, you can simply close RepetiTouch by long clicking on the blue star.\n\nFeatures:\n- record &amp; replay global touchscreen input\n- record &amp; replay hardware buttons or other device input via &quot;Additional Input Events&quot; (only on certain devices)\n- edit recordings (see http://cygery.com/wordpress/faqs/use-editormerger/ for details)\n- pause replay\n- Locale/Tasker support\n- draggable, customizable panel\n- load &amp; save records\n- auto-save/auto-load last record\n- loop replay with configurable loop counts (start by long clicking on the replay button)\n- dim screen while replaying (only on certain devices)\n- hide panel while replaying\n- appending record (start by long clicking on the record button)\n\nPermissions:\nSuperuser: Needed to record&amp;replay the touch events.\nDraw over other apps: Needed to display the panel.\nRead phone status and identity: Needed to stop record/replay on a phone call.\nModify or delete the contents of your USB storage: Needed to save a record on your external storage.\nRun at startup: Automatically start after booting\nGoogle Play license check: Needed to check the license of this app.\n\nWhat's New\nsupport for more devices\nsmall fixes and improvements\n\n\nPLease Seed As LonG As PoSsible\nEnjoY..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4274ab5d09053f426e4dbac47b1bb285af2089f","amp;dn":"RepetiTouch+Pro+%5BRoot%5D+1.0.17%5BKrazy8%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4274ab5d09053f426e4dbac47b1bb285af2089f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,39,74,181,208,144,83,244,38,228,219,172,71,177,187,40,90,242,8,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
