Mixing myth and ritual with avant-garde dance and film techniques, Maya forged a creative language that continues to resound in the very best of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experimental artists. The music here moves from nostalgia to mystery, capturing the many moods of MayaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life and art. Performed by Erik Friedlander, Jamie Saft and Cyro Baptista, In the Mirror of Maya Deren also features the unique piano stylings of John Zorn over three dreamy string arrangements. From Klezmer to classical, Haitian drumming to Indonesian gamelan, easy listening to minimalism, this score is one of ZornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most beautiful and touching listening experiences. \n\nPersonnel:\nCyro Baptista: Percussion\nErik Friedlander: Cello\nJamie Saft: Piano, Organ, Wurlitzer\nJohn Zorn: Piano, Percussion \n\n\n    &quot;Drifting 1&quot; - 2:13\n    &quot;Dancing&quot; - 5:12\n    &quot;Kiev 1&quot; - 3:57\n    &quot;Teiji's Time&quot; - 2:16\n    &quot;Nostalgia 1&quot; - 3:41\n    &quot;Filming&quot; - 5:51\n    &quot;Mirror Worlds&quot; - 1:50\n    &quot;Nightscape&quot; - 2:27\n    &quot;Nostalgia 2&quot; - 4:21\n    &quot;Haiti&quot; - 2:34\n    &quot;Kiev 2&quot; - 4:42\n    &quot;Voudoun&quot; - 3:27\n    &quot;Drifting 2&quot; - 2:12\n    &quot;Kiev 3&quot; - 4:41\n    &quot;Drifting 3&quot; - 2:17\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86b0c52c52ae37bad9d6f0d24fa31fc0cd6e357a","amp;dn":"John+Zorn+-+Filmworks+10+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86b0c52c52ae37bad9d6f0d24fa31fc0cd6e357a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,176,197,44,82,174,55,186,217,214,240,210,79,163,31,192,205,110,53,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
