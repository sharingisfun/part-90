A cadre of colourful cutthroats will cross your path on your travels, all with their own motivations and plans, but make sure to choose your crew with care!\n\nThe fast paced combat system in RavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cry is based on the traditional art of fencing, combined with historical firearms, the always messy hook, and good old fashioned street fighting, allowing players to dispatch foes in a variety of grisly ways. ChristopherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hook acts as both a symbol of his childhood tragedy and a brutal tool of his revenge, playing a crucial role in Ã¢â‚¬Å“RavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Upgrade your abilities and learn new skills and attacks that will make your enemies literally tremble in fear. How you kill is up to you, and as long as Christopher is the last man standing, no trick is too dirty, and no attack is off limits. The more violent and depraved your actions become the more you will influence your surroundings, as both foes and citizens alike will learn to fear you, sometimes with unexpected consequences. Regardless of whether you play as a badass or just a plain bad guy, Ã¢â‚¬Å“RavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ offers multiple ways to gain victory; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to you to decide if Christopher reaches his goal with his soul intact.\n\nChristopherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s raven has been with him since the day his family was killed, always reminding him of how much he has lost. Much like his fearsome hook, the raven has become a tool of ChristopherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revenge, strangely seeming to be linked to Christopher, almost as if it understands his wishesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and desires revenge as well.\n\nChristopher takes control of various ships on his crusade, and few are acquired legally. He can gain a reputation on the high seas just as easily as he can in port, and your actions will influence your enemies, causing them to be cautious of you and keep their distance, or forcing them to join up with other pirates to attack you en masse. Christopher is not without resources of his own however, as his ships can be upgraded and customized for a price. Christopher can also fly different flags, misleading his enemies and hiding his identity.\n\nAs captain of the ship, you must maintain complete control of your ship and crew at all times. Your men will follow your orders, but you must make sure theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re well taken care of to ensure their complete cooperation. A crewÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s morale is the lifeblood of any vessel, and they will complete their ordered tasks as well as you treat them. No matter how well you care for your crew, sometimes as captain you just have to do things yourself. Ã¢â‚¬Å“RavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ offers few Ã¢â‚¬Å“helping toolsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ during battle, so you must be on your toes and ready to act at a momentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notice. Ã¢â‚¬Å“RavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is more interested in realism than hand-holding, so youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find no beams of light showing your cannon-ball trajectory, nor will an auto aim assist you in precision shots to take out your enemies masts. Gain enough experience, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll earn new skills, like the passive Ã¢â‚¬Å“pack ratÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that allows you to store more goods on your vessel, and the feared Ã¢â‚¬Å“son of a gunÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ perk that increases the damage you deal with your firearms and cannons.\n\nChristopher is dedicated to his revenge, but waging a one-man war can be expensive, and Christopher is far from rich. Earning gold is critical in Ã¢â‚¬Å“RavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and there are a variety of ways to obtain it; from smuggling and trading, to looting and robbing, Christopher must keep his coffers well stocked in order to be prepared for whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to come. Gold and information are the most important currencies in Ã¢â‚¬Å“RavenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and more often than not, the two go hand in hand.\n\nFEATURES\n\nBeautiful cinematic cut scenes bring ChristopherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark quest to life\nThe open world of the Caribbean features a robust core storyline as well as dozens of side quests and secrets waiting to be explored\nCountless activities to take on, from smuggling and looting to treasure and bounty hunting\nMorally grey decisions influence the story and character interactions, creating a unique gaming experience\nPsychological elements based on player actions influence the fighting styles and habits of your enemies.\nComplex and unique skill trees on both land and sea are affected by ChristopherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notoriety level\nUnlockable raven skills give your bird more to do than fly around, as it takes an active role in your adventure\nA challenging fighting system based on classic hackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢slash action and tactical free-flowing combat includes blocks, counters, parries and finishing moves\nDetailed and historically accurate weapons and ships bring the 18th century Caribbean to life.\nSpecial combos with the unique and brutal hook\nFighting influenced by your surroundings; wet pistols may not fire, and muddy swamps will slow your offensive and defensive actions\nIntense naval battles with myriad ships and multiple ammunition types replicate the brutality of historic naval battles\nNotoriety and interchangeable flags influence the behaviour of the different controlling factions in the Caribbean\nRumors and whispers; information and knowledge are as precious as gold.
