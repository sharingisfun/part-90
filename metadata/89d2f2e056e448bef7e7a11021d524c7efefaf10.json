Notable for its very limited animation, yet imaginative stories, the series was a surprise hit at the time, and could be seen on 65 stations nationwide in 1960.\n\n\nBecause of budgetary limitations and the pressure to create television animation within a tight time frame, the show was the first to use the &quot;Syncro-Vox&quot; optical printing system. Syncro-Vox was invented by Edwin Gillette, television cameraman and partner in Cambria Studios, as a means of superimposing real human mouths on the faces of animals for the popular &quot;talking animal&quot; commercials of the 1950s.
