We'll then jump right in an start blocking in our run; adding extremes and breakdowns. Once this is finished, we'll begin polishing the animation, which includes refining arcs, achieving weight and balance, as well as solidifying each pose. \n\nWe'll also learn how to mirror and transfer animation to work faster, and learn how to translate the run forward. In the end, you'll not only learn how to animate a run cycle, but, more importantly, learn techniques that can be used to improve the quality of your animations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:405134159db6c671c4788cf25e99bd0131892c90","amp;dn":"Creating+Run+Cycles+in+Maya+-+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"405134159db6c671c4788cf25e99bd0131892c90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,81,52,21,157,182,198,113,196,120,140,242,94,153,189,1,49,137,44,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
