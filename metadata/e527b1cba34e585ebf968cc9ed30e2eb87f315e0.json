J. Ch. accommodata in linguam bohemicam musikamque redacta Ã¢â‚¬â€œ que redacta per Jac. Joa. Ryba) is a classic pastoral mass written by the Czech composer Jakub Jan Ryba in 1796. Because of its opening words, it is also known as Hail, Master! or Hey, Master! (in Czech: Hej, mistÃ…â„¢e!). Czech Christmas Mass was composed in a frame of traditional Latin mass (with parts Kyrie, Gloria etc.), the story is based on Christian theme of the birth of Jesus of Nazareth. Despite this, the work has a rather pastoral character with emphasis on a Czech description of the nativity in a Czech setting. During the centuries, the composition became the most popular Christmas mass in Czech countries and one of the musical symbols of Czech Christmas.\n\n[b]The music of Ryba's mass along with paintings by Josef Lada appear in a 2007 animated film called Ã„Å’eskÃƒÂ¡ mÃ…Â¡e vÃƒÂ¡noÃ„ï¿½nÃƒÂ­ (Czech Christmas Mass).[/b]\n\n[b]TVRip[/b]\n[b]Runtime[/b] 00:42:00\n[b]Video[/b] MPEG-4 AVC/H.264, ~1 500 kpbs\n[b]Resolution[/b] 766x576\n[b]Audio[/b] AAC , 2.0, 128 kpbs, czech\n\nThe mass consists of nine parts:\n\n1.
