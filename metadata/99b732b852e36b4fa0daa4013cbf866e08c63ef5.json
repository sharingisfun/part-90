Yes there the few worthwhile and genuine bands that came as a result (Alter Bridge being the best example) but are outnumbered vastly by the hordes of soulless, cookie cutter acts devoid of originality, deviation and substance. Step forward Las VegasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ own Otherwise.\n\nLatest album Peace At All Costs (Century Media) is yet another exercise in ticking all the boxes in the Fisher Price book of rock clichÃƒÂ©s. The typical harder tracks sit side by side with the obligatory softer, near acoustic ballads whilst lyrically it conveys the all too familiar matter of over compensating, alpha male vs forced emotional sentimentality.\n\nFar from being the worst band in this arena of rock music however; with the occasional strong riff, especially the opening one in Ã¢â‚¬ËœFor The Fallen OnesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ which has an Alter Bridge metallic vibe to it. Otherwise PeaceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ is a completely forgettable example of a modern day hard rock album with no imagination and even less heart and feel.\n\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFile size                                : 103 MiB\nDuration                                 : 45mn 06s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Constant\nOverall bit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : Peace At All Costs\nAlbum/Performer                          : Otherwise\nPerformer                                : Otherwise\nEncoded by                               : Callixtus\nPublisher                                : Century Media Records, Ltd.\nGenre                                    : General Mainstream Rock\nRecorded date                            : 2014\nCopyright                                : Callixtus\nCover                                    : Yes\nCover type                               : Cover (front)\nCover MIME                               : image/jpeg\nComment                                  : Callixtus\nEncoder                                  : Callixtus\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nDuration                                 : 45mn 06s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\n\n\n***TRACKLISTING***\n\n\n1 IV \t\n2 Love &amp; War \t\n3 Darker Side of the Moon \t\n4 Demon Fighter \t\n5 Wake Up (Coming For the Throne) \t\n6 Never Say \t\n7 The Other Side of Truth \t\n8 All the Pretty Things \t\n9 Walk Away \t\n10 For the Fallen Ones \t\n11 Fate is Your Enemy \t\n12 V \t\n13 Meet Me In the Dark \t\n14 Man On Fire\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99b732b852e36b4fa0daa4013cbf866e08c63ef5","amp;dn":"Otherwise+%5BPeace+At+All+Costs%5D+2014+CDRip+320Kbps+MP3+CALLIXTUS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99b732b852e36b4fa0daa4013cbf866e08c63ef5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,183,50,184,82,227,107,79,160,218,164,1,60,191,134,110,8,198,62,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
