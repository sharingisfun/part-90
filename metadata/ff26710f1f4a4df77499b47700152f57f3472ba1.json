We hear that the President will be addressing ISIS tonight, talk about the skills that ISIS has on social media, and hear from a few callers. Ant tells us about a statement that Joe Rogan made on Jon Jones, we talk &quot;click baiting,&quot; and watch and discuss a video from the kids of Ferguson. We then get into a video of Mike Tyson on Canadian TV, Keith tells us a sweet little cop story, and we tolerate additional listener calls. Ant wraps up with some entertainment news by updating us on Joan Rivers death and with a Justin Bieber news story.\n\n**Not shot in HD today so no bitching about it**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff26710f1f4a4df77499b47700152f57f3472ba1","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-09-10+%28MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff26710f1f4a4df77499b47700152f57f3472ba1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,38,113,15,31,74,77,247,116,153,180,119,0,21,47,87,243,71,43,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
