It was released in 1972, and was the primary vehicle/effort for the Vangelis project. It had a minor Album Oriented Radio hit in Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Four HorsemenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and the song Ã¢â‚¬Å“BreakÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was also released. The album was ostensibly an adaptation of Biblical passages from the book of the same name, but was also very experimental in lyrics and composition.\n\nAll Music Review\n\nAn amazingly bombastic concept album about the Apocalypse of St. John seen as a rock spectacle. Demis Roussos wails the lyrics in a frantically operatic falsetto, while the band pound fiercely through VangelisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ furiously complex music. It certainly has its moments, but the entire set eventually becomes too overwhelming to sit through.\n\nReleased     June 1972\nRecorded     Late 1970 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Early 1971 (3 Months) Studio Europa-Sonor, Paris, France\nGenre     Progressive rock, psychedelic rock, experimental rock\nLabel     Vertigo UIGY-9561\nProducer     Vangelis Papathanassiou\nLength     1:18:50\n\n1.
