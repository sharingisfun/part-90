Get it here!\n\nIt's suitable for anyone - if you've never tried DF before, or played for years - because while I've set up all the included parts already, the core is as easily accessible to you:  you can add, remove, update, replace whatever you want to and customise the pack as much as you want.  The tools I've included make the game easier to get into, but avoid changing any of the fundamentals - there are no mods here.  Dwarf Fortress can be confusing enough to play, but doesn't need to be hard to set up too.\n\nChangelog:\n - edited CLA tileset for punctuation with TwbT\n - updated default settings\n** updated Dwarf Fortress to 40_12\n - all graphics are compatible this time; no need for an update\n - updated PerfectWorld to 1.8; supports current DF version and temperature maps\n - added the PyLNP launcher v0.4; will eventually replace the current launcher - provided for testing, feedback, and configuration.\n - updated DFHack to 40.12-r1\n - updated TwbT to v3.41; next-gen coming soon\n - updated script manager-quantity\n\nMD5:  0AFB073A27C33D5E926C13AAE944738A","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca812226aa2cfa46ea0b5c0e72c8303d613467a4","amp;dn":"Dwarf+Fortress+40_12+Starter+Pack+r1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca812226aa2cfa46ea0b5c0e72c8303d613467a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,129,34,38,170,44,250,70,234,11,92,14,114,200,48,61,97,52,103,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
