Mediumship is the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sophomore record, and right from the bat, you can tell where the band is going. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Even BotherÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is both a good introduction and a warning to potential listeners. If you have never liked emo, then you really shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even bother. However, if you have been a fan of the resurgence of emotional rock, then Dikembe will be a welcome addition to your discography. Unfortunately, the rest of the album doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t present anything else of great interest. Vocalist Steven Gray has done a good job on the album, even if his intonation and melodies are quite familiar. His voice bears more than a slight resemblance to Jesse Lacey.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9325cebce2901996f6fb9fddeefbdc11acde943f","amp;dn":"Dikembe+-+Mediumship+%282014%29+www.mp3boo.com","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9325cebce2901996f6fb9fddeefbdc11acde943f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,37,206,188,226,144,25,150,246,251,159,221,238,251,220,17,172,222,148,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
