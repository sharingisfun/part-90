Most tracks compiled by DJ Patrick Forge of Da Lata fame. The original UK series span 7 volumes from 1991 to 1998.\nThere are considerable differences between the UK &amp; US versions. The UK catalogue nrs always start with: BRCD (cd) or BRLP (vinyl)...\n\n\nThe Rebirth Of Cool was at the time when it was released a very fresh series. Now, it is History.\nIt is relatively easy to make good compilation albums in retrospect and for that Mastercuts is a great example. The people behind the Rebirth Of Cool series were completely aware that they were contributing for the defenition of something and in a way shaping it by contextualizing the music. &quot;The nineties will be the decade of a jazz thing, welcome to the story so far...&quot; so starts the introduction of the first volume. Notice a certain assertiveness? Well, all seven volumes (and particularly the first three) have that quality, they almost feel like statements.\nThis is not a tedious series in any way. The tracks were carefully chosen and they really cover some of the most interesting scenes of the early nineties. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TUyNHSK.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TUyNHSK.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01.
