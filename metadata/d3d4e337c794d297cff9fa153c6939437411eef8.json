Some tracks you will definitely be familiar with, others are completely fresh and surprising. BOOSTER IV will be especially for those a delicacy who missed out the PURPLE DILUVIAL cupdisc which ran out of stock rather quickly in 2008, all three tracks 'Babylon the great has Fallen', 'Armageddon in the Rose Garden Part II' and 'Purple Diluvial 2010' (re-recorded version) are on this compilation. Enjoy another acoustic highlight maybe in your car, on your mp3 player, in your bath tub or wherever you prefer listening to a genuine and timeless piece of music from Tangerine Dream","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3d4e337c794d297cff9fa153c6939437411eef8","amp;dn":"Tangerine+Dream+-+Booster+1-7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3d4e337c794d297cff9fa153c6939437411eef8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,212,227,55,199,148,210,151,207,249,250,21,60,105,57,67,116,17,238,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
