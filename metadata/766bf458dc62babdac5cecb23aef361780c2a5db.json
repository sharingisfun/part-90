Mellencamp rose to superstardom in the 1980s while &quot;honing an almost startlingly plainspoken writing style that, starting in 1982, yielded a string of Top 10 singles,&quot;[1] including &quot;Hurts So Good,&quot; &quot;Jack &amp; Diane,&quot; &quot;Crumblin' Down,&quot; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pink Houses,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Lonely Ol' Night,&quot; &quot;Small Town,&quot; &quot;R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.,&quot; &quot;Paper in Fire,&quot; and &quot;Cherry Bomb.&quot; He has sold over 40 million albums worldwide and has amassed 22 Top 40 hits in the United States. In addition, he holds the record for the most tracks by a solo artist to hit number-one on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, with seven, and has been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, winning one. On September 23, 2014, Mellencamp will release Plain Spoken, his 20th album of original material and the follow-up to his critically acclaimed 2010 album No Better Than This.\n\nwiki","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:766bf458dc62babdac5cecb23aef361780c2a5db","amp;dn":"John+Cougar+Mellencamp+-21albums-FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"766bf458dc62babdac5cecb23aef361780c2a5db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,107,244,88,220,98,186,189,172,92,236,178,58,239,54,23,128,194,165,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
