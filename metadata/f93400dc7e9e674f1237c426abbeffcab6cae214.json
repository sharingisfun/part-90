Obviously more than the civilian she claims to be, he's sure Vivi is hiding an agenda...and he's determined to stick by her side until he uncovers all her secrets.\n\nA covert agent who shrouds herself in disguises, and who fearlessly jumps into dangerous situations without thoughts for her own safety, Vivi has no need for a protector. But if she is to have any hope of completing her most important mission, she'll have no choice but to recruit Jazz and his men.\n\nAnd when everything explodes around them, they will need each other more than they ever imagined","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f93400dc7e9e674f1237c426abbeffcab6cae214","amp;dn":"Gennita+Low-Protector","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f93400dc7e9e674f1237c426abbeffcab6cae214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,52,0,220,126,158,103,79,18,55,196,38,171,190,255,202,182,202,226,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
