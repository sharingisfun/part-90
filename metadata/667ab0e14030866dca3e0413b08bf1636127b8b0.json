Dissecting marshals the work of more than a dozen researchers to subject the conventional historiography of the &quot;gas chambers&quot;, the &quot;six million&quot;, the postwar trials, and other linchpins of the extermination story to careful, precise, methodical, and withering analysis. Germar Rudolf on how chemical analysis gravely weakens the case for gassing in the Auschwitz-Birkenau crematoria, Carlo Mattogno and Franco Deana on the crematory ovens of Auschwitz, Robert Faurisson, Manfred KÃƒÂ¶hler, and Claus Jordan on how testimony was coerced and convictions manufactured, Fritz Berg, Ingrid Weckert, Carlo Mattogno, and Arnulf Neumaier on the technical and evidentiary absurdities of gassing claims for German trucks in gas chambers and at Majdanek and Treblinka, Udo Walendy and John Ball on analysis of photos alleged to depict the crimes or their locations, Rudolf on the evidence for Jewish losses during WWII, JÃƒÂ¼rgen Graf on myths about the concentration camps, and more.
