Now four years later heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still trying to put the pieces of his broken world back together. Nothing will ever be the same but he refuses to admit that to anyone because it would mean accepting defeat and he will not allow his past to control his future. CJ Durie never knew his father dealt in human trafficking and when he did discover the truth it was too late to save Samuel. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kept his distance, keeping their mating bond a secret. It tore his heart out to do so but it was the right thing to do. Seeing Samuel after four years apart, CJ knows he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t live without him. But the question is, does Samuel feel the same? Love and the promise to never hurt Samuel is all CJ can offer, but is it enough? Will Samuel allow a reminder of his past to enter his future?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dc0295e0882143786e28688a2bc0900a02c1a84","amp;dn":"His+Unbreakable+Mate+-+17+by+A+J+Jarrett+%5BePub%2C+MOBI+%26amp%3B+PDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dc0295e0882143786e28688a2bc0900a02c1a84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,192,41,94,8,130,20,55,134,226,134,136,162,188,9,0,160,44,26,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
