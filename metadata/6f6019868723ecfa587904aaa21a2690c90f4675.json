Both a quick reference tool and a fluid read, the book focuses on the Ã¢â‚¬Å“how tos,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ such as setting up a lesson plan, running a discussion, and grading, as well as issues specific to the teaching assistantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique role as both student and teacher.\n \nThis new edition incorporates newer teaching and learning pedagogy. The authors have modified sections on moving from class goals to class content, preparing for and running discussions, addressing problems within the class and with particular students, and responding to academic misconduct. In addition, the book has been updated to reflect the role of technology both inside and outside the classroom. Also included are new examples of materials throughout the text and the appendices.\n\nFile size: epub 1.18 MB, mobi 935 KB\n\n\n\nNote 1: Testing of chapter and internal links were done with: Calibre for PC, Moon+ Reader and Aldiko for Android, Kindle and Mobipocket Reader for PC, and Kindle for Android.\n\nNote 2: There are great little apps for pdfÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like Flip for both PC and device.\n\nNote 3: For ereader applications with no magnification ability I have retyped and included the information contained on the back cover.\n\nNote 4: Some ereaders cannot recognize special symbols such as arrows. In Ã¢â‚¬ËœLate WorkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Chapter 8, end of first paragraph Ã¢â‚¬â€œ replaced the arrow with the word Ã¢â‚¬ËœtoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ so it reads Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃ¢â‚¬Â¦quality of the work (e.g., Ã¢â‚¬Å“B to BÃ¢â‚¬â€œ (late)Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½).Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nNote 5: There is a 3rd Edition in print which came out in 2011. Available at places like Amazon, bookdepository, and fishpond.\n\n\nEnjoy.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f6019868723ecfa587904aaa21a2690c90f4675","amp;dn":"First+Day+to+Final+Grade+ebook+Anne+Curzan+Lisa+Damour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f6019868723ecfa587904aaa21a2690c90f4675","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,96,25,134,135,35,236,250,88,121,4,170,162,26,38,144,201,15,70,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
