They emerged from the same Los Angeles scene that spawned Van Halen, MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e, Dokken, Ratt, imageRiot, Guns N' Roses and others. The band's popularity peaked in the 1980s, yet they continue to record and tour, making them one of the most enduring of the West Coast heavy metal bands. W.A.S.P. gained notoriety for their shock rock themed image, lyrics and live performances. They have sold over 12 million copies of their albums.\n\nThe band was a prominent target in the mid-1980s of the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), an organization that pushed for warning labels on recorded music.
