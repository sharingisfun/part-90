On February 18, 2014 on Twitter Jerry stated that the first single should come out &quot;somewhere around July&quot;. They did a live studio chat on YouTube on February 25, 2014. In the live chat they mentioned that they have already written 4 songs. They revealed the titles of three songs: 'Just As Broken As Me', 'Gravity' and 'War Over Me'. On April 24, 2014 on an interview for Loudwire Jacoby revealed a few more song titles from the upcoming album, the titles were 'Never Have To Say Goodbye' and 'Face Everything and Rise'.\n\n\nOn July 10, 2014, it was announced that the band will release their new album, titled F.E.A.R. (Face Everything and Rise), in early 2015. On October 09, 2014, it was announced that the new album will release on January 27, 2015 via Eleven Seven Music\n\n\nPapa Roach have confirmed details of their new album, F.E.A.R!\n\n\nThe Cali rockers will celebrating the 15th anniversary of Infest (15 YEARS?!! We feel oldÃ¢â‚¬Â¦) with their eighth full-length.. The album was recorded earlier this year, in Las Vegas with Kevin and Kane Churko (Ozzy Osbourne, Hellyeah, In This Moment, Five Finger Death Punch).\n\n\nFrontman and all-round awesome dude Jacoby Shaddix tells us: Ã¢â‚¬Å“There obviously has been an element of hope within the despair of the music that we write, and I think that thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always key, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very important to what we do, is to always have that element of hope, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s laced throughout the record.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n[Technical Info / Uploader Comments]\n\nThe album came from another source, it was labelled as 320kbps. Looking at the above spectrogram it's clearly stating 'NOT 320kbps' and that it's more likely a 192kbps upconvert which obviously cuts off at 16Khtz. The choice to download (or not) is entirely yours. Do not flame the comments box if you fail to read the torrent information page .... that's your obligation, uploaders put a lot of work into making the info pages for YOUR benefit and they're not just there to make the package look pretty or to meet site requirements.\nanalogkid6103 Speaks: After reading what the original creater had to say and than making my own call I will label this as a transcode which translates to 192kbps. Fuck it transcode is the call if you like tell us If you dont than throw it out. I have seen transcodes go up the ladder so . Give it a listen as always there will be ypur own analysis. analogkid6103- Truth In Torrenting image\nI have listened to the album, it sounds clear and better than the 192kbps shown on the spectrogram... some folks say NEVER judge audio quality using spectrogram readouts.... I can hear, on this file, why they would say that. ..... thank you for reading this. It's pretty decent.
