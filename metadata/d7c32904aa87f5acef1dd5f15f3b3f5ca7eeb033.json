The cavalry of the auxilia provided a powerful fighting arm; organized, disciplined and well trained, it was adept at performing both skirmish and shock action. This book details the many roles of the Roman auxiliary cavalryman, including reconnaissance, communication and policing duties, as well as in battle. Motivation for enlisting, conditions of service and experience of battle are all explored, and colour illustrations support the text","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7c32904aa87f5acef1dd5f15f3b3f5ca7eeb033","amp;dn":"Roman+Auxiliary+Cavalryman%3A+AD+14-193","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7c32904aa87f5acef1dd5f15f3b3f5ca7eeb033","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,195,41,4,170,135,245,172,239,29,213,241,95,59,63,92,167,238,176,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
