Really, how much would     \n things change?                                                             \n                                                                            \n In our 22 minute documentary, titled, Appetite for Change, celebrity chef  \n and former cattle farmer, Lynton Tapp, will meet some naive Aussies,       \n innocently shopping at their local supermarket. He'll analyse their        \n shopping trolleys to open their eyes, hearts and minds to the imminent     \n results of climate change, not only to farmers, communities and produce    \n but how it will affect things closer to home and their own way of life.    \n                                                                            \n Lynton will go on a journey of discovery to meet the farmers and families  \n who are at the frontline of our food supply chain and we'll watch him whip \n up some delicious meals using the farmers' local produce. Together, with   \n some of the world's leading scientists, we'll discover just how much our   \n lives will change and the devastating effect it will have not only on our  \n way of life, communities and loved ones, but the planet as well.           \n____________________________________________________________________________\n                                                                            \n RELEASE NOTES                                                              \n                                                                            \n\n Enjoy!                                                                     \n____________________________________________________________________________\n                                                                            \n GROUP NOTES                                                                \n                                                                            \n\n No current needs.                                                          \n____________________________________________________________________________\n                                                                            \n CONTACT iNFO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0a845e8019e88b982a69cc6eb6eb374f27a4b09","amp;dn":"Appetite.for.Change.PDTV.x264-WNN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0a845e8019e88b982a69cc6eb6eb374f27a4b09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,168,69,232,1,158,136,185,130,166,156,198,235,110,179,116,242,122,75,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
