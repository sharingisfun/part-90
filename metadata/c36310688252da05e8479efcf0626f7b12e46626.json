This ancient land was once home to many powersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and even death is not quite eternal. The commonersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ great hero, Vatha Urusander, is being promoted by his followers to take Mother DarkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hand in marriage, but her Consort, Lord Draconus, stands in the way of such ambitions. The impending clash sends fissures throughout the realm, and as rumors of civil war burn through the masses, an ancient power emerges from the long dead seas. Caught in the middle of it all are the First Sons of Darkness, Anomander, Andarist, and Silchas Ruin of the Purake Hold.\n\nSteven Erikson brings to life this ancient and important tale set in the world he introduced in the Malazan Book of the Fallen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c36310688252da05e8479efcf0626f7b12e46626","amp;dn":"Steven+Erikson+Kharkanas+trilogy+book+1%3A+Forge+of+Darkness+E-boo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c36310688252da05e8479efcf0626f7b12e46626","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,99,16,104,130,82,218,5,232,71,158,252,240,98,111,123,18,228,102,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
