That part's\ncrucial'the sleazy shout-alongs, the\nimplied physicality of its focus on\nrhythm above all else, the moment when\nenough repetition elevates music about\ndancing and fucking from hedonistic to\ntranscendental 'but there's more to the\nscrappy, prolific house label than the\ndirty stuff. Over more than a decade\nand almost 300 records, Dance Mania\nstaked its claim as ghetto house's\nMotown, holding its own as the brash,\nDIY counterpart to more\ninternationally-established,\ncrossover-primed Chicago peers like\nTraxx and DJ International. Sure, the\nstuff that hewed a bit closer to\nhouse's disco roots got the European\nlicensing deals, but Dance Mania's\ndeep, familial roster got the\novercrowded projects of Chicago's south\nand west sides, the ones Parris\nMitchell immortalized on 1995's &quot;Ghetto\nShout Out&quot;, where guys like DJ Deeon\nand Jammin Gerald were DJing Kraftwerk,\ngangsta rap, Ron Hardy, and their own\nbedroom recordings. The music was raw,\nexplicit, often escapist, and made do\nwith the resources available, and as\nsuch, its apparent simplicity was often\ndeceptive. In as much as anything can\nbe about shaking asses, Dance Mania\nmade music about shaking asses. But as\nthe buttcheek-thinkpiece industrial\ncomplex should suggest, for better or\nworse, it's never really just about\nshaking asses.\nLast year's Hardcore Traxx: Dance Mania\nRecords 1986-1997, released via Strut,\nmarked the first official compilatory\nsurvey of the label, and it arrived on\nthe heels of Parris Mitchell and owner\nRay Barney's 2013 announcement of Dance\nMania's re-launch. (It shuttered\ngracefully in 2001; the label's\ncommitment to musical risk-taking had\nalways relied on the financial success\nof its primary role as a record\ndistribution hub, a foundation that\ncrumbled in the late '90s as the\nindependent retailers it serviced began\nto disappear.) That compilation focused\non the label's most essential tracks,\ndocumenting straightforward but\nformative early work like Hercules'\n1986 &quot;7 Ways&quot;, the label's second-ever\npressing, as it grew leaner, rawer, and\nlewder by way of flirtation with acid,\nhip-hop, and techno. These are records\nthat never crossed over into the\nmainstream in any significant sense\n(beyond the errant Daft Punk shout-out)\nbut often sell for thousands of dollars\non Discogs today, thanks to a recent\nsurge in popularity among primarily\nEuropean collectors. It's a familiar\nparadox for Rust Belt dance music\ninnovators looking to keep their legacy\nalive: if financial viability is at all\na priority, artists risk a loss of\ncrucial context as they invest in\noutside markets.\nContrary to the pulp extremism of its\ntitle, Ghetto Madness, Strut's second\nDance Mania tribute, homes in on\nsubtler, deeper-digging gems in the\nlabel's sprawling catalog. Where\nHardcore Traxx gave special attention\nto ghetto house's formative years,\nGhetto Madness sticks primarily to\nDance Mania's mid-'90s heyday, by which\npoint the label had found its niche and\ndug deep, its dogged prolificacy\nspeeding up to match the steadily\nincreasing BPMs. The tracks are\nbrittle, matter-of-fact, mostly\npercussive, and often devoted to giddy\nmythologizing of the city's myriad\npleasures. But Ghetto Madness also\nmakes a case for the deeply meditative\nnature of these tracks at their best,\nand proves the bawdy shout-outs that\nhave become ghetto house's calling card\nare hardly representative of the genre\nas a whole. Tracks like DJ Rush rarity\n&quot;The Reactor&quot; and DJ Deeon's &quot;1112&quot; are\nentirely non-vocal, closer to\nstraight-up techno than any of the\nlabel's earlier jacking anthems or\nhip-house workouts. Compared to the\nhyper, in-your-face instructionals of\nsome of Tyree Cooper's late-'80s\nsingles, soul-sampling album highlight\n&quot;Nuthin' Wrong&quot;, originally released in\n1995, feels strikingly restrained.\nThere's subtlety here. And along with\nhorny entreaties for girls to shake\ntheir shit, there's real community\noutreach, too: DJ Milton's &quot;House-O-\nMatics&quot; celebrates the Chicago dance\ncrew of the same name, effectively an\nafter-school program as much as it was\na performance team.\nFrom a strictly commercial standpoint,\nEurope's new generation of Dance Mania\nfanatics with disposable income would\nbe reason enough for Strut's second DM\nreissue in two years. But in the\ncontext of house musics renewed\nrelevance on the global pop charts, the\ncommitment to Dance Mania homage takes\non a special poignance. At a glance,\nhouse's most visible torchbearers in\n2015 are, for the most part,\nprecocious, white British boys often\nnot yet old enough to legally get into\nthe American clubs they sell out. With\nthe commercial success of festival-\nprimed EDM acts and the increasing\nreliance on overseas touring for\nhouse's pioneers, some have wondered if\nhouse still matters in its hometown of\nChicago. But doubting the movement's\npersistent relevance in its hometown\nignores a fundamental truth: House\nnever left Chicago, it simply changed\nforms. Steadily evolving over its three\ndecades of existence, house has\nappeared as disco re-routed through\nMIDI, motivational hip-house, warp-\nspeed juke, and abstracted footwork.\nThe legacy of Dance Mania's insouciant,\ntrail-blazing ghetto house is preserved\nin the city's flourishing juke and\nfootwork communities as much as it\nlives on through the label's second\nlife; Ghetto Madness is just a\nreminder.\n\npsst, more info at strut-records.com\n\n01     Jammin Gerald - Pump That Shit Up                    04:10\n02     Dj Deeon - The Freaks                                03:41\n03     Dj Deeon - 1112                                      07:05\n04     Steve Poindexter - Computer Madness                  04:16\n05     Darien - Hit It                                      04:20\n06     Dj Rush - The Reactor                                04:18\n07     Wax Master Maurice - Bounce That Booty               03:53\n08     Tyree - Nuthin Wrong                                 05:58\n09     Jammin Gerald - Pump On The Floor                    03:32\n10     Paul Johnson - Give Me Ecstasy                       06:15\n11     Parris Mitchell - Ghetto Booty                       05:34\n12     Dj Milton - House-O-Matics                           04:53\n13     Dj Funk - Computer Sex                               04:07\n14     Dj Funk - Bitches                                    02:42\n15     Houz' Mon - The Groove                               05:23","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47c30756f74925810b36e24f5786d51a6d02195a","amp;dn":"VA-Dance_Mania_Ghetto_Madness-%28STRUT120CD%29-Promo-CD-2015-jAZzMan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47c30756f74925810b36e24f5786d51a6d02195a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,195,7,86,247,73,37,129,11,54,226,79,87,134,213,26,109,2,25,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
