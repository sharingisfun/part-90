Polish authorities suspected that they were German civilians that were killed by advancing Soviet forces. A Polish archeologist supervising the exhumation, said, &quot;We are dealing with a mass grave of civilians, probably of German origin. The presence of children . . . suggests they were civilians.&quot;\n\nDuring World War II, the German Nazi regime committed great crimes against innocent civilian victims: Jews, Poles, Russians, Serbs, and other people of Central and Eastern Europe. At warÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s end, however, innocent German civilians in turn became victims of crimes against humanity. Forgotten Voices lets these victims of ethnic cleansing tell their story in their own words, so that they and what they endured are not forgotten. This volume is an important supplement to the voices of victims of totalitarianism and has been written in order to keep the historical record clear.\n\nSupplementary maps and pictures are available online at http://www.forgottenvoices.net\n\n356 pages\nPublisher: Transaction Publishers (March 12, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1412843022\nISBN-13: 978-1412843027","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dca9508bf0bcb7751ca995eee8dfb29d162b1234","amp;dn":"Forgotten+Voices%3A+Expulsion+of+Germans+After+World+War+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dca9508bf0bcb7751ca995eee8dfb29d162b1234","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,169,80,139,240,188,183,117,28,169,149,238,232,223,178,157,22,43,18,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
