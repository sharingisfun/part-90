The research credits run about seven minutes. Many of the  archive images and stills have been seen by few previously.\n\nAs always I encourage libraries and also schools to get the original package.\nIt contains discussion notes for teachers and comes in two lengths on the original disk: this full version and one geared to an hour long school classroom presentation.\n\nYou can find more at the film's site using your search tools.\n\n--\n\nFor a year or more I have torrented the film International Sweethearts of Rhythm\n\nmy other torrents can be seen here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/loninappleton&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/loninappleton&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSome of the interviewees such as Roz Kron and others from the Sweethearts appear on this film as well.  But there is a lot more.  It had me getting emotional that such a film got made showing the larger role of women in jazz as players and also leaders and arrangers.  \n\nEnjoy the film.  But don't let it end at your desktop.  It is a teaching tool and is of great benefit to youngsters who want to pursue music.\n\nNotes written March 28th, 2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a00bf1dea5526d05eec2e14906cd258859ea505","amp;dn":"The+Girls+In+The+Band+%282014%29++documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a00bf1dea5526d05eec2e14906cd258859ea505","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,0,191,29,234,85,38,208,94,236,46,20,144,108,210,88,133,158,165,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
