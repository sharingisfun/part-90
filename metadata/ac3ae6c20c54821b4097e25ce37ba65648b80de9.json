Murray\n\nIn Homosexualities, one of the world's leading authorities on global homosexualities has produced a magnum opus. Breathtaking in its historical and geographical scope, Stephen O. Murray's landmark work provides a sweeping examination of the construction of male and female homosexualities, stressing both the variability of the forms same-sex desire can take and the key recurring patterns it has formed throughout history. From imperial China to Tudor England, and from medieval Egypt to the Ottoman Empire to modern-day Japan, Murray expertly explores the full range of both behavior and meaning in same-sex relationships.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac3ae6c20c54821b4097e25ce37ba65648b80de9","amp;dn":"Homosexualities+by+Stephen+O.+Murray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac3ae6c20c54821b4097e25ce37ba65648b80de9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,58,230,194,12,84,130,27,64,151,226,92,227,123,166,86,72,184,13,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
