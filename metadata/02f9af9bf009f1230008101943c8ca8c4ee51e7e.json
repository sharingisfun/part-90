Center fielder Luke &quot;Wizard&quot; Wallace steps up to the plateÃ¢â‚¬â€and is hit by a beanball, a wild pitch that shatters his skull, destroys the vision in his left eye, and changes his life forever.\n\nIn this riveting novel, the events surrounding this pivotal moment are recounted through free-verse monologues by 28 different voices, including those of Luke and his Oak Grove teammates; the pitcher, Kyle Dawkins, and other Compton players; the two coaches; Luke's family members and teachers; and Sarah Edgerton, a new classmate who seems more affected by Luke's injury than his girlfriend is.\n\nWith its unusual format, gripping subject matter, and economy of language, Beanball is a thought-provoking, fast-paced read.\n\n\nGenre: Sports &amp; Recreations | Childrens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02f9af9bf009f1230008101943c8ca8c4ee51e7e","amp;dn":"Beanball+-+Gene+Fehler+%28retail%29+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02f9af9bf009f1230008101943c8ca8c4ee51e7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,249,175,155,240,9,241,35,0,8,16,25,67,200,202,140,78,229,30,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
