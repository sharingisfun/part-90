USE IT - BREAK IT - FIX IT - AND BUY MORE IF YOU TRASH IT AND UPGRADE YOUR MUSIC COLLECTION BECAUSE THEIR WORK IS SUPPOSED TO BE SUPPORTED IN ALL WAYS POSSIBLE! \n\nThis audiovisual DJ mix video is made with full respect for respective artist and all kudos goes to them for inserting their awesome tunes into our ears. \n\n-\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nI made this audiovisual DJ mix late in the night after reviewing &quot;Ghetto Funk Mix June 2014&quot; from last summer that has poor audio quality on some of the tracks used. This one has good sound though on all of its 24 carefully selected and uttermost delicious ghetto funk tunes that are derived from the Interwebz.\n\nNow, for those who don't know what a ghettoblaster is (that also can be written in two words as 'ghetto blaster') or for that matter wonder what heck ghetto funk is anyway, let me quote Urban Dictionary:\n\nGhetto Funk: &quot;A mid-tempo electronic music genre that blends breakbeat, funk, hip-hop, and bass music. Could perhaps be seen as a modified form of &quot;nu-funk&quot; or &quot;breakbeat&quot; in itself. The underground movement is best represented by the eponymous blog www.ghettofunk.co.uk, which also releases exclusive promotions for artists of the scene.&quot; - http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ghetto+Funk\n\nGhetto Blaster: &quot;A large, portable, radio cassette player, measuring about 1.5 m wide and 1.0 m high. It is played especially outdoors, in public places at loud volume; and carried on one shoulder with loudspeakers facing the head. It is assumed that bypassers share the same musical taste.&quot; - http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ghetto+blaster\n\nSo, are you ready to jam? I am!\n\nFeel free to share this video around.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n-\n\nPROCEDURE:\n\nThe audio tracks used are mixed by me with MixMeister Studio v7.4.4.0 and the visuals in the video was made by me using a combination of the MilkDrop visualization plug-in v2.25c, Winamp v5.666, FRAPS v3.5.99, Sony Vegas Pro v13.0 and some feel for the beat in synergy with my trusted midi-tower Blitz - the Intel Core 2 Quad and 2 x ATi HD5770 powered wingman of choice. \n\n-\n\nINFO:\n\nTitle: DNSK - The Ghettoblaster: Rock Steady\nContent: Audiovisual art\nType: Music video\nYear: 2015\nFormat: MP4\nVideo: MilkDrop v2.25c / 29,970 fps; 1280x720 Progressive; YUV; VBR 8 Mbps; AVC\nAudio: DNSK - The Ghettoblaster: Rock Steady / 320 Kbps; 44Ã‚Â 100 Hz; 16 Bit; Stereo; AAC\nDuration: 01:17:51\n\n-\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01.
