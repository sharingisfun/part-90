This one is from VHS tape, so accept that the quality will be VHS and not crisp DVD.\n\nI've seen a  few other rips around (on YouTube and Pirate Bay) but they all seem to be low res. This one is full res (720x576) from a PAL VHS.\n\n\nI have a _very_ slow rural connection so can seed only for a limited time. Be grateful if some other seeders can help out ASAP.\n\n\nFilm Details:\n\nTitle: Robin Williams Live at the Met\n\nYear: 1986\n\nRuntime: 1:05\n \n \nTORRENT DETAILS\n \nLanguage: English\n \nVideo: XviD 25 fps 2500kbps\n \nAudio: MP3 48000Hz 128kbps\n \nSize: 1259 MB\n \nResolution: 720 x 576\n \nSource: PAL VHS TAPE - Released by Vestron Video\n \nConverted from uncompressed AVI with Any Video Converter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ccbe26dcf6bfa10a897236d1a8ee28afa282b60","amp;dn":"Robin.Williams.Live.at.the.Met.1986.VHS-RIP.RARE.720x576.xvid-He","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ccbe26dcf6bfa10a897236d1a8ee28afa282b60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,203,226,109,207,107,250,16,168,151,35,109,26,142,226,138,250,40,43,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
