Claiming to be checking up on security prior to his arrival, a group of FBI agents arrive at the home of the Bensons, on top of a hill that looks down upon the station where the Presidential train is due to stop. However, they soon turn out to be assassins led by the ruthless John Baron (Frank Sinatra), who take over the house and hold the family hostage.\n\nSheriff Tod Shaw (Sterling Hayden) arrives with Dan Carney (Willis Bouchey), a Secret Service agent in charge of the President's security detail. When he does, Baron and his gangsters shoot Carney and a bullet fractures Shaw's arm.\n\nBaron sends one of his two henchmen to double-check on the President's schedule but he is killed in a shootout with the police. Jud (James O'Hara), a television repairman, shows up at the house and also becomes a hostage. Pidge (Kim Charney) goes to his grandfather's dresser to fetch some medication and notices a fully loaded revolver which he replaces with his toy cap gun.\n\nBaron is confronted by the sheriff on the risks and meaning of killing the President and Baron's remaining henchman begins showing some reluctance. For Baron, however, these are the very least of his concerns and it soon becomes clear that he is a psychopath whose pleasure comes from killing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who and why he kills being the least of his problems.\n\nA sniper's rifle has been mounted on a metal table by a window. Jud discreetly hooks the table up to the 5000 volt plate output of the family television. Pop Benson (James Gleason) then spills a cup of water on the floor beneath the table. Although the hope is that Baron will be shocked to death, his remaining henchman touches the table first and is electrocuted, firing the rifle repeatedly and attracting the attention of police at the train station as he struggles to free himself. Baron shoots Jud, disconnects the electrical hookup and aims the rifle as the president's train arrives at the station, but to his surprise, doesn't stop (having been alerted to the risk). Ellen Benson (Nancy Gates) shoots Baron in the chest and Shaw shoots him again. Baron's last words are, &quot;Don't... please.&quot;\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Man with the Golden Arm (1955) - Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak [DDR]\n\nThe Man with the Golden Arm is a 1955 American drama film, based on the novel of the same name by Nelson Algren, which tells the story of a heroin addict who gets clean while in prison, but struggles to stay that way in the outside world. It stars Frank Sinatra, Eleanor Parker, Kim Novak, Arnold Stang and Darren McGavin. It was adapted for the screen by Walter Newman, Lewis Meltzer and Ben Hecht (uncredited), and directed by Otto Preminger.\n\nIt was nominated for three Academy Awards: Sinatra for Best Actor in a Leading Role, Joseph C. Wright and Darrell Silvera for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White and Elmer Bernstein for Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture. Sinatra was also nominated for best actor awards by the BAFTAs and The New York Film Critics.\n\nThe film was controversial for its time; the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) refused to certify the film because it showed drug addiction. The black-and-white film uniquely portrayed heroin as a serious literary topic as it rejected the standard &quot;dope fiend&quot; approach of the time. It was the first of its kind to tackle the marginalized issue of illicit drug use. Because it dealt with the taboo subject of &quot;narcotics,&quot; Hollywood's Production Code refused to grant a seal of approval for the film, and it was released without the MPAA's seal of approval. This sparked a change in production codes, allowing movies more freedom to more deeply explore hitherto taboo subjects such as drug abuse, kidnapping, abortion and prostitution. In the end, the film received the code number 17011.\n\nDirector Otto Preminger had previously released a film lacking the Production Code with The Moon is Blue (1953). He told Peter Bogdanovich why he was attracted to Algren's novel: &quot;I think there's a great tragedy in any human being who gets hooked on something, whether it's heroin or love or a woman or whatever.&quot;\n\nFrank Sinatra Ã¢â‚¬â€ who jumped at a chance to star in the film before reading the entire script Ã¢â‚¬â€ spent time at drug rehabilitation clinics observing addicts going cold turkey. The script was given to Marlon Brando around the same time as Sinatra, who still harboured some anger at Brando, since the latter had beaten Sinatra for the lead role in On the Waterfront.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Frank Sinatra as Frankie &quot;Dealer&quot; Machine\n    Eleanor Parker as Zosh Machine\n    Kim Novak as Molly\n    Arnold Stang as Sparrow\n    Darren McGavin as Louie Fomorowski\n    Robert Strauss as Zero Schwiefka\n    John Conte as Drunky John\n    Doro Merande as Vi\n    George E.

Steve soon finds out that the egomaniacal Owen has gone through a series of secretaries who have left when they are fed up with his behaviour. He is constantly in debt and cannot begin to write a contracted novel that will pay his bills including a lucrative advance by his publisher. Steve perseveres until the novel, based on the events of Steve's life and that mentions a character based on his publisher shown in an unflattering light, is refused publication.\n\nOwen claims he cannot have a wife and a secretary so fires his wife and goes back to his old ways, hiring an admiring and attractive female to be his secretary. In the meantime Steve takes Owen's rejected manuscript to her former companion, Charles Harris, who is a major publisher. Harris, who now employs Elsie, Owen's former secretary before Steve, also asks to see Steve's manuscript.\n\nHarris finds Owen's manuscript interesting but ordinary, but believes Steve's manuscript to be not only worthy of publication but a serious candidate for literary prizes. Steve initially refuses publication due to hurting Owen's fragile ego but soon changes her mind because of the philandering. She hires an attractive male secretary and the two writers compete with each other.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Big Trees (1952) - Kirk Douglas, Eve Miller [DDR]\n\nThe Big Trees is a 1952 film starring Kirk Douglas and directed by Felix E.

The land is already settled by, among others, a religious group led by Elder Bixby (Charles Meredith) who have a religious relationship with the redwoods and refuse to log them, using other smaller trees for lumber. Jim becomes infatuated with Bixby's daughter, Alicia (Eve Miller), though that does not change his plan to cheat the homesteaders. When Jim's right-hand man, Yukon Burns (Edgar Buchanan) finds out, he changes sides and leads the locals in resisting Jim. The locals combat Jim's loggers with a sympathetic judge with Jim fighting back by using Federal laws.\n\nElder Bixby is killed when a big sequoia tree is chopped down by Jim's men and falls on his cabin. Jim's desperate attempt to rescue Alicia's father saves him from being convicted of murder. Meanwhile, timber rival Cleve Gregg (Harry Cording) appears on the scene, making it a three-way fight. Gregg and his partner Frenchy LeCroix (John Archer) try to assassinate Jim, but end up killing Yukon instead. Jim has a dramatic change of heart and leads the settlers in defeating Gregg and Frenchy. Afterwards, Jim marries Alicia and settles down.\n\nStudents from Humboldt State University played members of the Quaker congregation and members of its choir.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec:MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 3368 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second:29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nSubtitles:None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]    \nRun Time 378 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5c1232cca2745ddc54de1cd0dc8b4a5c6c89540","amp;dn":"Suddenly+1954+-+Man+with+the+Golden+Arm+1955+-+My+Dear+Secretary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5c1232cca2745ddc54de1cd0dc8b4a5c6c89540","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,193,35,44,202,39,69,221,197,77,225,205,13,200,180,165,198,200,149,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
