(1962)\nThe gambling habit of lawyer Steve Flood (Dean Martin) is beginning to get on the nerves of his wife Melanie (Lana Turner), who initially suspects him of marital infidelity. When she learns about the gambling, Melanie talks Steve's law partner Clint Morgan (Eddie Albert), an old flame, into helping her act as a fictitious horse race bookie offering unusually attractive terms to clients.\n\nThe plan is for Steve to lose enough money to permanently rid him of the betting habit, but it goes awry when he suddenly begins winning bets on a number of long-shot horses. FloodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s winning streak attracts the attention of two horse-playing judges, Boatwright (Paul Ford) and Fogel (John McGiver), who persuade Flood to place bets for them with his mysterious Ã¢â‚¬Å“bookie.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Melanie and Morgan are astounded when the judges begin winning large wagers as well.\n\nThe make-believe bookmaking activity arouses the ire of syndicate mobster Tony Gagoots (Walter Matthau), who is furious to know whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“getting the action.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ GagootsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mistress, a nightclub singer named Saturday Knight (Nita Talbot), happens to be the FloodsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ next-door neighbor, and assists Melanie in raising cash for the gambling payoffs by purchasing various furnishings from the FloodsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ apartment (using GagootsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ill-gotten money).\n\nThe source of the mysterious Ã¢â‚¬Å“bookmakingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is traced to the FloodsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ apartment by Gagoots through an illegal telephone wiretap. He and a team of thugs descend upon the apartment, where they are surprised to find all the defecting gamblers assembled. They are thunderstruck when a coercive interrogation reveals that Melanie Flood is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“bookieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ they have been seeking.\n\nSteve Flood ultimately convinces Gagoots to forgive all of their gambling debts by arguing that only by marrying his mistress Saturday can he avoid the risk of incriminating testimony. In one stroke this fulfills SaturdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long-sought goal, saves the FloodsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ marriage, insulates Gagoots from future prosecution and clears MelanieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s $18,000 gambling payoff burden.\n\nPRODUCTION NOTES:-\nThe storyline is based on the 1960 novel Four Horse Players Are Missing by Alexander Rose, who also plays a minor role in the film (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mr. GoodyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). \nThis novel, in turn, was closely related to the Damon Runyon short story Little Miss Marker.\nMany of the scenes were filmed on location in FloodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s/KnightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s luxurious penthouse apartments in the historic Talmadge building on Los AngelesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Wilshire Boulevard; much of the automobile driving shown runs up and down Wilshire.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 804 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x272\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 2.353:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  1\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 93 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95c3afcb68d73be466ac192bfc42234b05292226","amp;dn":"Who%27s+Got+the+Action+%281962%29+Xvid+1cd+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95c3afcb68d73be466ac192bfc42234b05292226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,195,175,203,104,215,59,228,102,172,25,43,252,66,35,75,5,41,34,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
