They chose to remove it after pressure from the Norwegian Progress Party. This is the full original article. The Coverpage is edited. It says &quot;Censored by Per Sandberg&quot;. This is a pun directed towards Per Sandberg, Second leader of the Progress party, who has been complaining extensively about the progress party beeing censored in the Norwegian Media. It now seems like censorship is not so far from their heart after all.\n\nAnyways. It is a good journalistic review of the current far right political climate in scandinavia at the moment, and should as such be accessible to the general public","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c2797d3bb520874eccd3970b95a88fa6d04db14","amp;dn":"SAS_FarRight_CensoredbyFRP.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c2797d3bb520874eccd3970b95a88fa6d04db14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,39,151,211,187,82,8,116,236,205,57,112,185,90,136,250,109,4,219,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
