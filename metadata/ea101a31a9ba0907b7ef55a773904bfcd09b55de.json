The first discipline is a floor performance. Celebrities will receive comments and scores from the judges. After this, viewer voting opens. The celebrities will then perform their second discipline, either parallel bars (male celebrities) or beam (female celebrities). The scores for these disciplines will be revealed and added to the Show 5 judges' scoreboard. Scores will then be converted to points. Viewer voting will close as announced in the programme and viewer votes will then also be converted to points. Both sets of points are then combined (50/50) to form the end of show scoreboard. This will determine which celebrities are the 'bottom two'. These two will face 'the Vault'. One celebrity will then be eliminated after the vault performance.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 06-Sep-2014 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea101a31a9ba0907b7ef55a773904bfcd09b55de","amp;dn":"Tumble.UK.S01E05.Web-DL.x264-tilz.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea101a31a9ba0907b7ef55a773904bfcd09b55de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,16,26,49,169,186,9,7,183,239,85,167,115,144,75,252,208,155,85,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
