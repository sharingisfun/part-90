With multiple versions of &quot;The Word&quot; being quoted from the pulpit, it's too confusing trying to follow along in your own Bible.\nWhy has all this confusion hit the Lord's people? Since our life, faith, hope, growth, and trust is found in the Word of God, we cannot afford to be confused on this issue.\nIn plain, everyday language, Barry Burton explains the difference between the King James Bible and modern translations. Every Christian needs to know which Bible can be trusted . . . and why!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2d05da839b771454a4b61f8b0b0de23da4a801a","amp;dn":"Let%27s+Weigh+the+Evidence+-+Barry+Burton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2d05da839b771454a4b61f8b0b0de23da4a801a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,208,93,168,57,183,113,69,74,75,97,248,176,176,222,35,218,74,128,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
