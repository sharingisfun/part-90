Holiday cheer is in the air, gun-toting fruitcakes are in her office, and she's spinning through mood swings fast enough to make her toss her cookies--even without the morning sickness. \nWhen Ol' Kris Kringle goes AWOL after a nervous breakdown, his disgruntled elf is convinced that only Matilda can get him back on his sleigh in time to keep humans from tearing each other apart quicker than couponeers at a Black Friday sale. \nBut their efforts hit the skids when the men in Matilda's life show up and demand to know which of them is responsible for the bun in her oven: the hot hit man who's likely to stuff her stocking with ammunition, or the delicious demigod who's made Santa's naughty list a couple centuries running.\n\n\n\nBooks #1-6 can be found on the other sites i upload as TPB was not operational when i uploaded them.   \n\n\n\nPlease be aware that i want to seed 24h/d, however with a really old laptop, a connection of U:80.0 kB/s and multiple seeds \nsimultaneously my contribution will not be enough.
