Life in the open was of particular concern to early urban planners and reformers, with their dreams of release from the confines of overcrowded, unsanitary slums. Picturing youthful working-class bodies made healthy by exercise and tanned by the sun, they imagined an escape route from cities. Worpole demonstrates how open-air public spaces became sought-after commissions for many early modernist architects in the early 1900s, resulting in the transformation of the European cityscape.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d54d88db531ea2f6ec114b49e151231282b3b30","amp;dn":"Here+Comes+the+Sun+-+Architecture+and+Public+Space+in+European+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d54d88db531ea2f6ec114b49e151231282b3b30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,84,216,141,181,49,234,47,110,193,20,180,158,21,18,49,40,43,59,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
