In the process, Bourne begins to question who he really is and what he would become if he no longer carried the Bourne identity. Across the globe, an American passenger airliner is shot down over Egypt-apparently by an Iranian missile-leaving the world wondering if it was an accident or an act of aggression. A massive global team lead by Soraya Moore is assembled to investigate the attack before the situation escalates.\nWhen Bourne's search for his would-be assassin intersects with Soraya's search for the group behind the airplane bombing, Bourne is thrust into a race to prevent a new world war. But it may already be too late. - See more at: http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/eric-van-lustbader/robert-ludlums-tm-the-bourne-deception/9781455519439/#sthash.ohRtaS4c.dpuf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f1088126b0e564ec66fa0ec4b56f3c5a611df2d","amp;dn":"Robert+Ludlum+%28Bourne+07%29+-+The+Bourne+Deception","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f1088126b0e564ec66fa0ec4b56f3c5a611df2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,16,136,18,107,14,86,78,198,111,160,236,75,86,243,197,166,17,223,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
