This pattern is reflected in music, television, film, and literature.  The press keeps the term in print, and advertising capitalizes on the  concept.People have many perceptions of what the &quot;American  Dream&quot; is. For some, the dream is part of an ideology that snares and  deludes. The dream is often portrayed as jingoistic.
