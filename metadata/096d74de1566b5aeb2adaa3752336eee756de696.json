Her main concern is that she can only inherit a part of the family fortune if if her husband is alive. The Halorans are a strange family, still grieving over the death of the youngest daughter Kathleen who drowned in a pond when she was just a child. They hold an annual ceremony of remembrance every year on the anniversary of her death. This year however, someone is wielding an ax intent on murder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:096d74de1566b5aeb2adaa3752336eee756de696","amp;dn":"Dementia+13+%281963%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"096d74de1566b5aeb2adaa3752336eee756de696","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,109,116,222,21,102,181,174,178,173,170,55,82,51,110,238,117,109,230,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
