The following podcasts are included: #458, 469, 505, 527, 528, 548, 569, 577, 597. I will post a link to Freedomain Radio, as required by the CC attribution license under which these podcasts were released. However, I believe that the site's owner, Stefan Molyneux, may be running a destructive therapeutic cult with his wife Christina. You have been warned.
