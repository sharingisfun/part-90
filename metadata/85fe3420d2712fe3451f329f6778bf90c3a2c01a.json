The heroes are traveling across the lands of harsh but beautiful north Trudvang, but the longer they travel, the more they start to doubt the purpose of their journey. The Thronelander is a grown up, medium paced fantasy adventure, set in a beautiful landscape. We follow Falkjar, the disgraced soldier, Heidnar, the imposing berserker, Nonja, the jagged ranger, and Skarprund, the Jarl's scholar, as they cross the dangerous lands on their way to the sword.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85fe3420d2712fe3451f329f6778bf90c3a2c01a","amp;dn":"Drakar+och+Demoner+Trudvang+-+Tronla%CC%88ndaren.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85fe3420d2712fe3451f329f6778bf90c3a2c01a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,254,52,32,210,113,47,227,69,31,50,159,103,120,191,144,195,162,192,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
