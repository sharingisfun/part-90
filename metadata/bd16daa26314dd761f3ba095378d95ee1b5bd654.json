But few have had the skill, the charisma, or the success of the DiMaggio brothers. Joe DiMaggio, &quot;The Yankee Clipper,&quot; is an American icon and one of the greatest athletes of the twentieth century. Even his chief rival, Ted Williams, called him the greatest all-around player he ever saw.\n\nBut two of Joe's brothers, also center fielders, were dynamic players in their own right. Dominic, affectionately known as &quot;The Little Professor,&quot; was a seven-time All-Star who played for the Boston Red Sox from 1940 through 1953. He hit better than .300 five times in his career, finished with a .298 average, and like his big brother, rarely struck out. And Vince DiMaggio, the eldest, made two All-Star teams and in 1941 smacked 21 home runs and drove in 100 RBIs while playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nIn The DiMaggios, journalist Tom Clavin draws on a wealth of source materials, interviews with family members and teammates, and in-depth reporting to reveal how three kids from an immigrant family of eleven found their way to the upper echelons of American sports and popular culture. A vivid portrait of a family and the ways in which their shifting fortunes and status shaped their relationships, it is also a transporting exploration of an era and a culture, using baseball as a lens to view and understand American society in the twentieth century. \n\n\nGenre: Sports &amp; Recreations | Non Fiction | Biography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd16daa26314dd761f3ba095378d95ee1b5bd654","amp;dn":"The+DiMaggios+-+Tom+Clavin+%28retail%29+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd16daa26314dd761f3ba095378d95ee1b5bd654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,22,218,162,99,20,221,118,31,59,160,149,55,141,149,238,27,91,214,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
