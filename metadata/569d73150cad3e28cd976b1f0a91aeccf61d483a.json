Following this we'll see how we can adjust the placement of anchor points in addition to their bezier handles to dictate the direction and curvature of a path by using the direct selection and convert point tools. From here we'll learn how to apply a selection, stroke, and fill to paths. \n\nAs we continue on we'll also discuss how we can use the pen tool to create vector based shapes. Along the way we'll also discuss how to save paths, use path operations, and work with the freeform pen tool.
