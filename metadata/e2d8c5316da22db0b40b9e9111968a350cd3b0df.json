(&quot;Ben&quot;) Selvin (March 5, 1898 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ July 15, 1980), son of Russian-immigrant Jewish parents, was a musician, bandleader, record producer and innovator in recorded music. He was known as The Dean of Recorded Music.\n\nSelvin started his professional life at age 15 as a fiddle player in New York City night clubs (passing as older).\n\nSix years later, as leader of his own dance band, the &quot;Novelty Orchestra,&quot; Selvin released the biggest-selling popular song in the first quarter-century of recorded music, &quot;Dardanella&quot;.\n\nAccording to The Guinness Book of World Records, Selvin recorded more musical sides (on 78-rpm discs) than any other person. One reason for this prolific output is that he recorded for dozens of different labels during this high-growth time in the industry, using a different name (or slightly different name) for each label. Selvin's output has been estimated at 13,000 to 20,000 song titles (the liner notes say &quot;9,000-odd titles&quot;).\n\n*****************************************************************\n\nBEN SELVIN &amp; HIS ORCHESTRA - DARDANELLA\n\n01.
