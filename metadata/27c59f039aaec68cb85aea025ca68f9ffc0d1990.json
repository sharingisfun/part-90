With spectacular energy pulsating from every member of the band, the Rainbow Seekers could illuminate the very chambers of Heaven. Lead singer and Amish excommunicate Joe Hertler splashes through lyrical puddles of golden rain, leaving his audience wearing flowery headdresses and bubbling smiles. A ride on the Rainbow will take you across the mountains of Motown, through the fjords of folk, over the archipelagos of Americana, andÃ¢â‚¬â€at lastÃ¢â‚¬â€into a funky firth, where only the fiercest of friendships can be found.\n\nThe Rainbow Seekers began their quest beneath the fingertips of songwriter Joe Hertler. Bassist and producer Kevin Pritchard, recently thawed from an extremely rare prehistoric groove glacier, discovered the forlorn Hertler in a twinkling, mysteriously fortuitous place called The Quilted Attic. Alongside legendary glacier-hunter Rick HaleÃ¢â‚¬â€who would later spend decades forging a drumset from pure, white-hot, ancient stardust to mark the occasionÃ¢â‚¬â€Pritchard changed the world: He wrangled Hertler into musical collaboration. And the lonely little songsmith, it turned out, was not quite as alone as he seemed: With him came the irresistibly sexy blues guitar prodigy who is now known to the world as Ryan Hoger.\n\nThe core of the Rainbow was thereby established, and it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take long for the Rainbow Seekers to continue their expansion. Multi-instrumentalist and notable auxiliary percussion maestro Micah Bracken journeyed from the bowels of Atlantis when he heard tell of the Rainbow, and the earth trembled as saxophonist and all-around bad ass Aaron Stinson descended from Olympus on a golden rainbow of his own. Then came Stinson's little-known winged companion from the Far East, the debonair violist Joshua Barber HolcombÃ¢â‚¬â€When he saw the pure, unadulterated joy the Rainbow Seekers sprinkled on every crowd they happened upon, he had no choice but to join them on their quest.\n\nAs you'll know if you've seen the band, seeking the proverbial Rainbow is all about the live performance. &quot;The live show is the purpose of the band. This is why we make music. Playing music is a symbiotic process, and without a crowd it is just a bunch of guys jamming,&quot; says Hertler. &quot;We believe that performance is not a High Art operation, and that you should do anything you can to ensure that the crowd is having a good time. From piÃƒÂ±atas to confetti, to fog, to flowers, to drum solos, to strobe lights, to Thor, to sword battlesÃ¢â‚¬â€literally anything goes.&quot;\n\nIf you're still reading this, at least one thing is true: The Rainbow Seekers have been waiting for you. If you'll only let them, they will shake the dust from your wildest expectations. They will roar into your life with rapturous frequencies, exuberant tone, and a joyfulness of purpose that has truly become a rare sight on stage. Join them in their celebration, and they will take you on a never-ending journey to a place you'll never be able to describe in words","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27c59f039aaec68cb85aea025ca68f9ffc0d1990","amp;dn":"Joe+Hertler+and+The+Rainbow+Seekers-+Terra+Incognita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27c59f039aaec68cb85aea025ca68f9ffc0d1990","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,197,159,3,154,174,198,140,184,90,234,2,92,166,143,159,252,13,25,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
