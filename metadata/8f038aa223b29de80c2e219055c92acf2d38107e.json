Christie loves her new Talking Tina doll but her stepfather takes an immediate dislike to it. Anytime he is alone with the doll, it spouts abusive comments to the effect that it hates him and that it's going to kill him. He's convinced that his wife is behind it all, something she vehemently denies. He tries to get rid of the doll but it always seems to reappear - and also seems intent on following through with its threats.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f038aa223b29de80c2e219055c92acf2d38107e","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+Living+Doll","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f038aa223b29de80c2e219055c92acf2d38107e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,3,138,162,35,178,157,232,12,46,33,144,85,201,42,207,45,56,16,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
