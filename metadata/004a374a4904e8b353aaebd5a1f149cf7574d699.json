Fenton invites him up for a beer but having served in the Pacific during World War II isn't quite sure what to make of his visitor. He has his prejudices but wavers as Arthur says he was born in the USA and is no different than any other American. As they discuss their pasts, it's revealed that both men have lied and are haunted by what happened to them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:004a374a4904e8b353aaebd5a1f149cf7574d699","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+The+Encounter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"004a374a4904e8b353aaebd5a1f149cf7574d699","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,74,55,74,73,4,232,179,83,170,235,213,161,241,73,207,117,116,214,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
