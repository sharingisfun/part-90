Taking the philosophical concepts outlined in his earlier book, &quot;This Time the World,&quot; Rockwell distilled his political message into a hard-hitting, easy-to-read volume which is guaranteed to leave the reader shaken, despite having first been published in 1966. As a Commander and Navy fighter pilot in both World War II and Korea, Rockwell said that everything for which he had fought had been turned over to the Communists. Ã¢â‚¬Å“America was in the hands of arrogant gangs of Ã¢â‚¬ËœminorityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ agitators and power manipulators,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said Rockwell. He became a Ã¢â‚¬Å“conservative,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but decided that anyone too frightened to name the actual enemy would be worthless in the rough and tumble tight to come. In 1958, alone and without funds, he hung up the Swastika and founded the first openly National Socialist organization anywhere in the world after the end of the Second World War. Using dramatic street tactics, uniforms and planned publicity stunts, Rockwell soon attracted worldwide attention and a small band of followers across America. Initially calling his organization the &quot;American Nazi Party,&quot; propaganda re-alignments made necessary its steady growth caused him to rename it into the National Socialist White People's Party&quot; or NSWPP. Rockwell's highpoint came with a 3,000-strong rally at Marquette Park in Chicago in August 1966. Several successful marches and meetings took place shortly afterwards, and just as Rockwell seemed to pose a credible political threat, he was assassinated in August 1967, just a few months after this book was first published","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf13a2f290fcc6058feb8747e3cf90b494dd4e84","amp;dn":"White+Power","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf13a2f290fcc6058feb8747e3cf90b494dd4e84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,19,162,242,144,252,198,5,143,235,135,71,227,207,144,180,148,221,78,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
