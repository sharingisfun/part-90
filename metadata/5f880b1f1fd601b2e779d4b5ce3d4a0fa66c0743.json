Their philosophers debated just how much better was the love between men. In their epics that codified their sacred virtues, their mythical heroes loved one another just as often as their gods took mortal men as boyfriends. As lovers, male couples slayed tyrants at home and vanquished enemies abroad. In politics, almost all of their emperors loved men. But this is not a fairytale: such was the documented history of the Greco-Roman world spanning a millennium. What changed?
