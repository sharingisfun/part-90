Max Koch also calls in to talk Sopranos, oral sex, kleptomania, movies, and keeping your sack fresh. Ant reads a few submissions from people who would like to take part in the new &quot;unblock promotion,&quot; addresses the myth that he wakes up late, we watch the music video &quot;Call the Cops,&quot; check out an unreal video from a school, and then we are treated to a few more gems from the callers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e2227fe7aa268b2ee509aa24808b275f8983fc1","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-09-17","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e2227fe7aa268b2ee509aa24808b275f8983fc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,34,39,254,122,162,104,178,238,80,154,162,72,8,178,117,248,152,63,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
