Looked out and noticed 2 off-yellow lights in the sky. 1st thought it was one of our charter planes, but the light vanished and two other larger lights appeared next to each other a little higher. One light would vanish and another one would appear next to it. It spread across the sky then vanished. Clear night. I was downwind. No sound and there was nothing there after the lights vanished. My uncle, who has seen the lights out here before, saw them that night too. I knew it was not a plane. I used to sell planes and my father is a pilot. I quickly realized this was something off. I was amazed by what I saw. A week later my dad saw something similar, except they were multiple color. Were horizontal, went verticle, and them vanished. Something strange is going on in Stephenville.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb0ec5bcfbf92002663af394fdb3e13dbd2af7b9","amp;dn":"UFO+Sighting+-+Stephenville+Texas+%28Documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb0ec5bcfbf92002663af394fdb3e13dbd2af7b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,14,197,188,251,249,32,2,102,58,243,148,253,179,225,61,189,42,247,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
