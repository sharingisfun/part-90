She wants to continue pretending sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just human Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ only human, like her mother, like her friends. \n\nBut she isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t human. \n\nHeartbreak and betrayal send her off rushing to Scotland, to a familiar haven where she has spent so many summers with her father, but she soon discovers that everything has changed. \n\nFrom the moment she meets Quinn MacValdane, shock waves travel through him to her and back again, wrapping them in a tide of passion she had never dreamt possible. But if they are to have a future together, she must confront who and what she is, for she will need to call on the powers within her as she becomes embroiled in an adventure that will alter her life forever. \n\nThe time for pretending is over.[/color]\n\n[size=140][color=purple]IF YOU LIKE IT THEN SAY THANK YOU.\n+1 feedback To support me[/color][/size][:Qsmile][:Qsmile]\n[image=isqpKdgCkh][/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31c146838ff14477980962b91e41e04d68b94bdc","amp;dn":"Hungry+Moon-Quicksilver+%7BZ00Z33%7D+%7Bepub%2Cmobi%2Cazw3%2Cpdf%2Clit%2CfB2%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31c146838ff14477980962b91e41e04d68b94bdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,193,70,131,143,241,68,119,152,9,98,185,30,65,224,77,104,185,75,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
