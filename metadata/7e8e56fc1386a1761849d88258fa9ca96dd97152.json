The programme is presented by comedian Ed Byrne, and the bakers this time are Victoria Wood, Alexa Chung, Chris Moyles and Kayvan Novak.\n\nThey face three tricky challenges set by Mary and Paul. The celebrities serve up some unique twists on the signature bake (tray bake), tackle one of Paul's challenging recipes in the technical (12 crumpets) and get creative in the show-stopper challenge (vegetable cake self-portrait).\n\nTimings prove problematic for some and confidence crumbles, but who will demonstrate baking brilliance and be crowned star baker?\n\nThey're all baking to inspire you to do the same and raise some money for Comic Relief. Paul Hollywood visits a Comic Relief-funded project here in the UK to see how the cash you raise really can help change people's lives.\nShow less","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e8e56fc1386a1761849d88258fa9ca96dd97152","amp;dn":"The+Great+Comic+Relief+Bake+Off-S02E04--x264-SD-WebDL--STS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e8e56fc1386a1761849d88258fa9ca96dd97152","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,142,86,252,19,134,161,118,24,73,216,130,88,250,156,169,109,217,113,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
