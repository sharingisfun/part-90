West Ham hope to continue their winning record against Swansea, having taken the three points in their two previous Premier League meetings at Upton Park. In 2013 the Hammers went into this fixture in the relegation zone, but two goals from Kevin Nolan gave them a crucial victory. Plus Midlands rivals Aston Villa and Leicester meet in the league for the first time in over ten years, and both teams are desperate to take the bragging rights.\n\n\nOverall bit rate                         : 4 680 Kbps\nFrame rate                               : 50.000 fps\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=5 / deblock=1:-3:-3 /  me=umh / subme=10 me_range=24 /\n\n\n&quot;Once you've gone 50fps there's no going back&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc51c2622da5d171e75fdb89b45f6b197628487d","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+2+2014-12-07+720p+50fps+HDTV+x264--wAm.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc51c2622da5d171e75fdb89b45f6b197628487d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,81,194,98,45,165,209,113,231,95,219,137,180,95,107,25,118,40,72,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
