In an interview she recounted her performance of Elvis Presley's &quot;Can't Help Falling in Love With You&quot; at age four while on a trip to St. Tropez to an audience at the Hotel Byblos. &quot;I requested 'CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help falling in love with you' by Elvis and the performer asked if IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d sing it. I remember being so excited.&quot; She later explained the effect of seeing the 2003 Jack Black movie School of Rock had on her musical interests, &quot;I remember that changing my view of music completely! I started listening to AC/DC, Guns N' Roses, Red Hot Chili PeppersÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and I realized how much I loved rock music.&quot; Greenberg also cites Jimi Hendrix as &quot;one of my biggest inspirations&quot;.\n\nGreenberg began posting cover recordings of songs on YouTube in 2010 at age 15. In December 2012, Greenberg was selected as the Female Artist of the Month on the Star Central magazine's website. She also won Ryan Seacrest's &quot;Totally Covered Summer&quot; competition in August 2013 for a cover of &quot;Get Lucky&quot; by Daft Punk. Greenberg also drew significant attention for her cover of AC/DC's &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; posted in August 2013.\n\nGreenberg states that as much desire she has &quot;to be a [professional] musician&quot;, she intends to study economics at University College London","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c3d48b1253c9790c136cb4b6d85e2c5f8af317e","amp;dn":"JESS+GREENBERG+-+THE+ULTIMATE+VIDEO+COLLECTION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c3d48b1253c9790c136cb4b6d85e2c5f8af317e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,61,72,177,37,60,151,144,193,54,203,75,109,133,226,197,248,175,49,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
