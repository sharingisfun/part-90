Until now, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been one thing missing: an ultimate, fully-loaded, ridiculously overpacked reference book for every home project you can dream of; the compilation of our longstanding expertise; the home how-to book to crush all others. \n\nThe good news doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop there; Black &amp; Decker The Book of Home How-To is designed to reflect the way we search for information today. You wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find chapters or long, boring introductions or even a table of contents. This book is an A-to-Z encyclopedia with precise how-to INSTRUCTIONS and clear photos packed onto every page. With an expanded index that is incredibly intuitive and a simple, alphabetical strategy for organizing the information, you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t spend precious time wading through stuff you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to know. \n\nFinding first-rate information on home care has never been easier, and all the most common tasks around your home are coveredÃ¢â‚¬â€œincluding electrical, plumbing, flooring, walls, windows and doors, cabinetry, insulating, heating and cooling, roofing and siding, and just about any repair or remodeling project you can imagine.\n\n\nBy Editors of Cool Springs Press\nPublished by Cool Springs Press in 2014\nEPUB, 600 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b57023542ec9bd3817fd03087464177b0a75bba8","amp;dn":"The+Book+of+Home+How-To+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b57023542ec9bd3817fd03087464177b0a75bba8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,112,35,84,46,201,189,56,23,253,3,8,116,100,23,123,10,117,187,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
