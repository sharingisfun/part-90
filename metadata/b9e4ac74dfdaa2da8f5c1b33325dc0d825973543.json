But what the Amazon track list doesn't tell you is that it features JOHN LEE HOOKER on Lead Vocals. It's a stunning version - beautifully produced and stripped down to just acoustic guitars (foot-tapping) and his extraordinary voice. There's even witty banter between the two men at the end of the track. It's an unsung gem and whenever I play it in our London shop, it always brings customers to the counter asking 'what' John Lee Hooker album it's on. Apart from a Rhino 2CD &quot;Best Of&quot; from nearly two decades back, the track is only available here.\n\nAlso check out &quot;Tip Walk&quot; and &quot;Red Hot&quot; which both feature superlative keyboard contributions from legendary New Orleans piano-man and songwriter ALLEN TOUSSAINT (again not credited here).\n\nRoy Rogers' debut album received huge praise at the time of its American release on Blind Pig Records in September 1992 (it was reissued in the UK in 2010). Rogers plays superlative Slide Blues guitar both electric and acoustic - not as aggressive as say Johnny Winter - more Tommy Emmanuel on a Blues tip (a guitarist so good he has initials after his name). There are shades of Keb Mo here too.\n\n&quot;Slidewinder&quot; is a forgotten album now - but it beggars rediscovery big time. Great stuff and highly recommended - especially if you're like me and those rattling bluesy guitar-strings send you.\n\nPS: Rogers was the producer on John Lee Hooker's breakthrough collaborations album &quot;The Healer&quot; in 1989[/quote]\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Roy Rogers - Slidewinder (Blind Pig Records 72687)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Roy Rogers\nAlbum................: Slidewinder (Blind Pig Records 72687)\nGenre................: Blues\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1988\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 100 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
