The series began in 2003 with the release of Manhunt, and continued in 2007 with Manhunt 2. The name of the series and its games are derived from the term &quot;manhunt&quot; as used in law enforcement, where it refers to an intensive search for a dangerous fugitive. As of 26 March 2008, the Manhunt franchise has sold 1.7 million copies worldwide.[1]\n\nThe gameplay consists of a mixture of stealth and psychological horror elements played from a third-person perspective, and has gained controversy for its graphic violence. The games are in a form of an anthology series like many other Rockstar games, and so the plots of the two games are unrelated. Although both games focus on protagonists with dark pasts, who must attempt to escape from a particularly dangerous and perverse situation. The antagonist in each game is a character who has betrayed the protagonist, but over whom they exert a great degree of control and trust.\n\nThe cultural impact of Manhunt has been compared by the Chicago Tribune to that of A Clockwork Orange in the video game industry.[2]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40aa98c03a9d2dd635a3742911173c692384329c","amp;dn":"Manhunt+Collection+PS2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40aa98c03a9d2dd635a3742911173c692384329c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,170,152,192,58,157,45,214,53,163,116,41,17,23,60,105,35,132,50,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
