Particular emphasis is given to the journeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s major milestones: first, transcendence of the ego-self and revelation of the True Self in its oneness with God (the Unitive State). Second, the further movement into the marketplace that ultimately ends with the falling away of the True-self and the Unitive State. An overview of this passage reveals how and in what way the ultimate fulfillment of self or consciousness is no-Self or no-Consciousness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:661062e855583ecf02e8a875829fb30380c5e214","amp;dn":"A+Passage+Through+Self","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"661062e855583ecf02e8a875829fb30380c5e214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,16,98,232,85,88,62,207,2,232,168,117,130,159,179,3,128,197,226,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
