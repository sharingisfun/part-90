It was raining heavily at my warehouse space, which I had just moved into, and my room was filled with water. So for 3-5 days I spent writing and illustrating these two issues until the rain had stopped. The artwork was done with my non-dominant hand and the concept came from a more recent Cure album cover.\n\nIf you can find all the Random Word Placements, also known as RWPs, post your list on ShitGarden [http://shitgarden.proboards.com/] under the &quot;Spam Visual&quot; subfolder and as a reply on the thread &quot;Jason &amp; John RWP Findings&quot;.
