Ray's crew of men are friends, especially Ray with Steve, a young Romeo. Into the mix comes Gerry, an Australian with a spirit of adventure and mountain climbing skills. She wants a job, and against the others' advice, who don't want a woman on the job, Ray hires her. Then she and Ray fall in love. He asks her to marry him, gives her a ring. Steve's jealous; Ray's ex-wife complains that he spends on Gerry, not his own kids, and she predicts that Gerry won't stay around. Plus, there's pressure to finish the job fast. Economics, romance, and wanderlust spark the end","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1c0bdda7da6cbbfc95e0c7aba542e88d7eda62f","amp;dn":"Among+Giants+%5B1998%5D+FrHDgY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1c0bdda7da6cbbfc95e0c7aba542e88d7eda62f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,192,189,218,125,166,203,191,201,94,12,122,186,84,46,136,215,237,166,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
