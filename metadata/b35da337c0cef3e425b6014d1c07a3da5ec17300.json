I'll Still Be Around\n02. Woke Up This Morning\n03. The Thrill Is Gone\n04. When Love Comes To Town (U2) &gt; DJ Outro\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b35da337c0cef3e425b6014d1c07a3da5ec17300","amp;dn":"BB+King+-+Bluesfestival+Peer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b35da337c0cef3e425b6014d1c07a3da5ec17300","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,93,163,55,192,206,243,228,37,182,1,77,28,7,163,218,94,193,115,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
