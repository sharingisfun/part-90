In If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript, author Angus Croll imagines short JavaScript programs as written by famous wordsmiths. The result is a peculiar and charming combination of prose, poetry, and programming.\n\n\tThe best authors are those who obsess about languageÃ¢â‚¬â€and the same goes for JavaScript developers. To master either craft, you must experiment with language to develop your own style, your own idioms, and your own expressions. To that end, If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript playfully bridges the worlds of programming and literature for the literary geek in all of us","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac51fbef47728519e9d7419c0fd045a727b4a4a9","amp;dn":"If+Hemingway+Wrote+JavaScript+-+Angus+Croll+-+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac51fbef47728519e9d7419c0fd045a727b4a4a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,81,251,239,71,114,133,25,233,215,65,156,15,208,69,167,39,180,164,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
