When their vessel, the Nightingale 229, answers an emergency distress signal from a comet mining operation in a distant galaxy, the crew soon finds itself in danger from the mysterious young man they rescue, the alien artifact he's smuggled aboard, and the gravitational pull of a giant star about to supernova. The resulting explosion will be the most massive explosion in the universe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:650373b5d9e18434d175d87e838d1e68a4f93fae","amp;dn":"Supernova+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"650373b5d9e18434d175d87e838d1e68a4f93fae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,3,115,181,217,225,132,52,209,117,216,126,131,141,30,104,164,249,63,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
