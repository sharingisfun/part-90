The police investigate this, but are baffled, and unable to solve this mystery. The woman is Seth Durgadas' late wife. The police interview Seth Durgadas but nothing comes of it. In the meantime, Ranjeet (N.A. Ansari) rescues Sabita (Shakila), the only daughter of Seth Durgadas from the clutches of a tiger, and himself is disfigured for life. Out of pity, Durgadas appoints him manager of his organization and wealth, and soon a greedy Ranjeet starts showing his true colors, which ultimately result in the murder of Durgadas, and the prime suspect is none other than Suresh Kumar (Ajit), the man who Sabita loves. Sabita changes her mind, and Suresh disappears from their lives, apparently on the run. Ranjeet plots and schemes to drive Sabita mad, so that he can take over her wealth. \n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:- NR\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 730 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 352x272\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.294:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 224kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: Hindi\nRunTime: 2:17:36\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:899f30025d279e70abfc493ce9199945817375e0","amp;dn":"Tower+House+%281962%29+Xvid+1.0g+-+No+Subs+-+Ajit%2C+Shakila+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"899f30025d279e70abfc493ce9199945817375e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,159,48,2,93,39,158,112,171,252,73,60,233,25,153,69,129,115,117,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
