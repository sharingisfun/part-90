After a \nshort time Commander Conda, who was a session drummer at first, became a full member as well.\n\nInspired by the great Metal heroes of the 80's Iron Kobra started to play heavy speed Metal in the old german way.\n \n\nThe first demo CULT OF THE SNAKE was released in the beginning of 2009 and has now been released on tape via Dying Victims Productions as well.\n\n An EP by the name BATTLESWORD followed in 2010 and was met with great praise and success.\n \n\nAfter many great gigs and hours on the road, the band had to part ways with Commander Conda\nin 2011 and found a replacement in Ringo Snake - an able warrior who know puts steam into the\ndeath machine. A single, AVENGER, was recorded and pressed onto black wax, before \nmarching towards their first studio album, DUNGEON MASTERS, which was released in 2012. \n\nNow the band is pressing towards their second, album, MIGHT &amp; MAGIC, which will be \nreleased in early 2015. \n\n\n\n MIGHT &amp; MAGIC - 2015\n\n\n1. \tWords of Wisdom \t00:07 \t \n2. \tTomb of the Stygian King \t03:56 \t \n3. \tFire! \t04:32 \t \n4. \tVanguard of Doom \t02:50 \t  Show lyrics\n5. \tWatch the Skies \t05:41 \t \n6. \tSpirit Archer \t06:13 \t \n7. \tWut im Bauch \t04:22 \t \n8. \tBorn to Play on 10 \t03:14 \t \n9. \tCult of the Snake \t06:10 \t \n  \t37:05 \t \n\n\nPlayers\n\nRingo &quot;The Animal&quot; Snake \tDrums\nSir Serpent \tVocals, Guitars\nLightning Lord Python \tGuitars (lead), Vocals\nDon &quot;The Warrior&quot; Viper \tBass, Vocals (backing)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3febad429af642746b825e605f8f05b8e0cf2a76","amp;dn":"+++Iron+Kobra+-+Might+And+Magic+++2015++ak61","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3febad429af642746b825e605f8f05b8e0cf2a76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,235,173,66,154,246,66,116,107,130,94,96,95,143,5,184,224,207,42,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
