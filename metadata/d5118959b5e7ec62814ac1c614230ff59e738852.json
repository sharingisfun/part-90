(later known as Climax Mystery Theater) is an American anthology series that aired on CBS from 1954 to 1958. The series was hosted by William Lundigan and later co-hosted by Mary Costa. It was one of the few CBS programs of that era to be broadcast in color (using the massive TK-40A color cameras pioneered and manufactured by RCA, and used primarily by CBS' arch-rival network, NBC). Many of the episodes were performed and broadcast live, and although the series was transmitted in color, only black-and-white kinescope copies of some episodes survive to the present day. The series finished at #22 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1955-1956 season and #26 for 1956-1957","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5118959b5e7ec62814ac1c614230ff59e738852","amp;dn":"Climax%21+-+Season+2+-+The+Lou+Gehrig+Story+%7B1956%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5118959b5e7ec62814ac1c614230ff59e738852","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,17,137,89,181,231,236,98,129,74,193,198,20,35,15,245,158,115,136,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
