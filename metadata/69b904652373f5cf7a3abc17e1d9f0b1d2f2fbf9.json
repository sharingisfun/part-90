(ie. video data rate = 500 kbps) over at archive org. All of that, FOR FREE!\n\nWell a magnifying glass isn't going to help you with that quality of video. The best way to view it is at it's normal size or else it becomes so blurred you can't make out that there are people in there.\n\nBut as you can see from video #3 (I've Loved And Lost Again) that that episode is available somewhere in full quality both audio and video. It is simply too valuable for anyone to admit they have a copy and be forced to make it public.\n[/RANT]\n\nAnyway, I added 6 more tracks that I could scrape out of YouTube, and that appears to be all there is besides a few blurred &quot;flashing's of light&quot; that are said to be video recordings of Patsy Cline. Of these extra 6, one had to be re-encoded so that I could make a &quot;left cut&quot; (if you've done any video editing you know what I mean) and two were rescaled and in two cases I had to do some audio editing (noise removal and normalization).\n\nSo here is the track list as it now stands:\n\n01. Patsy Cline - A Church A Courtroom and Then Goodbye.avi\n02. Patsy Cline - Come On In 1.avi\n03. Patsy Cline - I've Loved And Lost Again (Ranch Party).avi\n04.
