His father was killed in the war to defend the homeland and not left good memories, his overprotective mother stopped to evolve as a man, his wife left him for another man and teachers and school - so well portrayed in the film - the oppressed by writing poems and music.\nWith all these reasons we finally got to the analogy of the name given to the movie: The Wall. Pink goes on to build a wall to get away from the rest of the world, where each of these reasons is part of that wall.\nThe most amazing movie is due to the fact that very few speeches, being told through the songs on the album The Wall and its exciting letters. This proves that Waters ever saw a movie in your head when composing what would be considered one of the best albums of progressive rock and one of the best films of the year.\n\nTitle in Brazil: Pink Floyd - The Wall\nOriginal Title: Pink Floyd - The Wall\nGenre: Musical\nRunning time: 163 minutes\nRelease Year: 1982\nDirected by Alan Parker\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084503/\n\nSize: 4.36 GB\nExtension Archive: .ISO\nVideo Quality: DVD-R\nVideo codec: MPEG-2\nAudio Codec: AC3 5.1\nResolution: 720 x 480\nAudio Language: English\nSubtitles: Portuguese / English / French\n\n\nSCREENS\ni300.photobucket.com/albums/nn5/gdepaiva/menu1-1.jpg\ni300.photobucket.com/albums/nn5/gdepaiva/menu2-1.jpg\n\n\nSEED PLEASE\n\nENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7245d2001afecfad0028d5fe8868d333a8991aff","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+The+Wall+1982+DVDR+ENG+R4+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7245d2001afecfad0028d5fe8868d333a8991aff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,69,210,0,26,254,207,173,0,40,213,254,136,104,211,51,168,153,26,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
