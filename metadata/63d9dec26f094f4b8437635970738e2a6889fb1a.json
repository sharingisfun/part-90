China maybe???\nTurning out be like a 2nd Vietnam war eh? Remember in Rambo 3 Colonel Samuel Trautman says to Colonel Zaysen,&quot; If you had studied your history, you would have found out that these people would rather die than give their country up. You can't defeat a people like that. We tried and we had our Vietnam. Now you're gonna have yours&quot;.\n\n\nAll wars on planet Earth are trade wars. Remember your Star Wars the Evil Galactic\nEmpire led by Darth Vader. You didn't know it but Afghanistan possesses incredible amounts of mineral resources that greedy nations of the world want(bees attracted to wildflowers). \n\nIts all there in the pdf file I made. Have a good read!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63d9dec26f094f4b8437635970738e2a6889fb1a","amp;dn":"America%27s+Interest+In+Afghanistan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63d9dec26f094f4b8437635970738e2a6889fb1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,217,222,194,111,9,79,75,132,55,99,89,112,115,142,42,104,137,251,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
