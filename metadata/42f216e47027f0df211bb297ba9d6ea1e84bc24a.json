Cities 97 was the premier radio station in the country to create a music sampler for charity. Since that time, Cities 97 has continued the tradition of bringing great music to the Twin Cities and with the help of our listeners we have raised more than one and a quarter million dollars for Minnesota charities. The proceeds have benefited &quot;Cities Kids&quot; at the Community University Health Center, a program that brings health care to children in need in the Twin Cities, and many others. The Cities Sampler Volume 10 is an exceptional collection of 18 unique tracks from local and national artists, many recorded during live in-studio performances and &quot;Traffic Jams.&quot; We hope you enjoy Volume 10, we think it's one of the best ever.\n\n 1.)
