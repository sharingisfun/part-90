His ship is badly damaged and likely beyond repair. He manages to contact his home base but they have little encouragement for him. They don't have a replacement spacecraft to rescue him and the security situation is such that they may soon be at war. Cook readies himself to make a home on his new world when he discovers another inhabitant, a human-like female from another world. As they learn to communicate, he learns her name is Eve Norda and together set off to begin a new life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:771d9ca03a3970c46fcf1ad1b6133dab31429892","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+Probe+7+Over+And+Out","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"771d9ca03a3970c46fcf1ad1b6133dab31429892","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,29,156,160,58,57,112,196,111,207,26,209,182,19,61,171,49,66,152,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
