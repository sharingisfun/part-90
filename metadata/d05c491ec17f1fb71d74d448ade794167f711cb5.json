Ã¢â‚¬Å“I will say that peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s speculation behind the unreleased songs meaning is not far off. Notes (referring the late producer) was a genius. He heard some basic arrangement i was messing with and literally splashed magic on it. Britney came up with the lyrics based on a personal poem she had been working on for a couple weeks leading up to our recording session. The original demo is still in my archives but because of Notes passing and my loyalty for Spears, I will not leak it until both camps feel its ready for public consumption.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nBritney wrote it with Jeff and Notes based off a poem she wrote several weeks prior to recording the demo. \n\n Dandurand says there IS a full length version, which according to him, is available from time to time on YouTube thanks to a fan who got it from the label. \n\n According to a private message with a fan and Dandurand, he says the song's about the ones who &quot;pull the strings.&quot;\n\n Dandurand claims he was warned by Britney and her team to never leak the song.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d05c491ec17f1fb71d74d448ade794167f711cb5","amp;dn":"Britney+Spears+-+Rebellion+%282014%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d05c491ec17f1fb71d74d448ade794167f711cb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,92,73,30,193,127,31,183,29,116,212,72,173,231,148,22,127,113,28,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
