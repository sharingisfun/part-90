The ambiguity inherent in phenomenology - between conscious experience and structural conditions - lent itself to a range of interpretations. Many existentialists developed phenomenology as conscious experience to analyse ethics and religion. Other phenomenologists developed notions of structural conditions to explore questions of science, mathematics, and conceptualization. &quot;Phenomenology: Responses and Developments&quot; covers all the major innovators in phenomenology - notably Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and the later Heidegger - and the major schools and issues. The volume also shows how phenomenological thinking encounters a limit, a limit most apparent in the aesthetical and hermeneutical development of phenomenology. The volume closes with an examination of the furthering of the division between analytic and continental philosophy.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: History of Continental Philosophy (Book 4)\nPDF: 337 pages\nPublisher: Routledge; Reprint edition (August 10, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1844656128\nISBN-13: 978-1844656127\nAmazon Link:\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b78e7807ee692773262357c357b99ed10d34b730","amp;dn":"Phenomenology%3A+Responses+and+Developments+%282014%29+%7B%3DIMPAVIDUS%3D%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b78e7807ee692773262357c357b99ed10d34b730","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,142,120,7,238,105,39,115,38,35,87,195,87,185,158,209,13,52,183,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
