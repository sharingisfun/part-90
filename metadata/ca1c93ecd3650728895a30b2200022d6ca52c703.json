Let me know what you all think, thank you.\n\n(This and the Michael Crichton Ebooks are my first &quot;self done&quot; torrents)\n\nTake off on the vacation of your dreams... and wake up to your worst nightmare! From Jurassic Park creator Michael Crichton comes this excellent, ingenious sci-fi thriller about a Wild West Fantasyland where amazingly like-like androids look, act and talk like the real thing... until something goes horribly wrong! Staring Yul Brynner, Richard Benjamin and James Brolin, and bristling with excellent special effects*(for 1973), Westworld is a hi-tech, futuristic, edge-of-your-seat suspense thriller that will leave you breathless.\n\nPeter Martin and John Blane (a nod to Crichton's alias John Lange) are two businessmen enjoying the ultimate frontier excursion. But when a programming error causes the town's &quot;residents&quot; to turn deadly,the two must square off against a strong-willed, steely-eyed, automated gunslinger who's determined to bring their vacation to a murderous conclusion. \n\n\nScreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fAagjAAGh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fAagjAAGh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/faagmaAgH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/faagmaAgH&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fAAGNaagH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/fAAGNaagH&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso since this is my first rip, I'm not sure what information is relevant. Please let me know if you have any suggestions or questions. Enjoy! Please seed!\nI know it says 1280*720, this came direct from the video information, however the movie itself is not a remastered release, its the actual 1973 version and I believe its closer to 720*480.\n\n      Format : Matroska\n      Format version : Version 1\n      File size : 3.18 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 29mn\n      Overall bit rate : 5 114 Kbps\n      Writing library : WonderShare Matroska Muxer\n\n   Video #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : Simple@L3\n      Format settings, BVOP : No\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Codec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/ASP\n      Codec ID/Info : Advanced Simple Profile\n      Duration : 1h 29mn\n      Width : 1 280 pixels\n      Height : 720 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate mode : Constant\n      Frame rate : 30.000 fps\n      Color space : YUV\n      Chroma subsampling : 4:2:0\n      Bit depth : 8 bits\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Compression mode : Lossy\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n      Default : Yes\n      Forced : No\n\n   Audio #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : AAC\n      Format/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\n      Format profile : LC\n      Codec ID : A_AAC\n      Duration : 1h 29mn\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : Front: L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Compression mode : Lossy\n      Default : Yes\n      Forced : No\n\n\nNew to all this, still trying to figure out the best way of compression without drastically hurting quality, hence the 3+GB size.
