Kehinde Wiley: An Economy of Grace follows the artist as he steps out of his comfort zone to create a series of paintings of women for the first time. Kehinde casts his models on the streets of New York and then enlists Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy to create couture gowns for each woman. The film traces the artist's process from concept to canvas as he reveals to us another side of black femininity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7820e487437d3977a4d060faf262b70b1839ef2a","amp;dn":"Kehinde+Wiley+An+Economy+of+Grace+Documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7820e487437d3977a4d060faf262b70b1839ef2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,32,228,135,67,125,57,119,164,208,96,250,242,98,183,11,24,57,239,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
