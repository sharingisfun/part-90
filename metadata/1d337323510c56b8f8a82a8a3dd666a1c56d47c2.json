However, the performance is more likely to be from December 1983, as the set list exactly matches known set lists from that time. Moreover, Jeff Pilson is listed as the bass guitar player on the recording, something that could not have been possible in 1981 since Juan Croucier played bass guitar for the group until after 1982. The song Live to Rock is featured on this album under this title, but in 1981 this song had different lyrics and was known under the title &quot;We're Illegal.&quot; Finally, according to Pilson, the recording is actually from a King Biscuit Flower Hour broadcast from December 1983.[citation needed] Why the album has been marketed as being from 1981 is unknown.\n\nThere are three previously unreleased songs included on the album: &quot;Goin' Down&quot;, &quot;Hit and Run&quot; and &quot;You're a Liar&quot;, as well slightly rearranged versions of some tracks from the Breaking the Chains album such as &quot;Paris Is Burning&quot;, &quot;Breakin' the Chains&quot; or &quot;Night Rider&quot;.\n\nFLAC\n\nDokken\n\nFrom Conception: Live 1981\n\nCD\n\nParis Is Burning (4:48)\nGoin' Down (3:42)\nIn the Middle (4:53)\nYoung Girls (3:55)\nHit and Run (3:51)\nNight Rider (8:15)\nGuitar Solo (2:58)\nLive to Rock (5:05)\nBreakin' the Chains (6:24)\nYou're a Liar (4:46)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d337323510c56b8f8a82a8a3dd666a1c56d47c2","amp;dn":"Dokken+-+From+Conception%3A+Live+1981+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d337323510c56b8f8a82a8a3dd666a1c56d47c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,51,115,35,81,12,86,184,248,168,42,138,61,214,102,161,197,109,71,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
