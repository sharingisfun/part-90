But you can create win-API-apps with the above include-files if you want.\n\nSecond Advantage: this compiler contains a fully-fledged Graphic-Library with all sorts of graphic commands, so you can utilize full graphical windows in your programs, just with easy PBasic-commands without ever needing to use the windows-API!\n\nThird Advantage: you can easily use all your old QuickBasic sources from DOS times , since PBCC is 95% compatible to QBasic/Quickbasic/GWBasic/BasicA/TurboBasic etc.)\n---\n\nHappy programming! :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac9259d62f1c986818e06d98bf40309648e7de14","amp;dn":"PowerBASIC+Console+Compiler+5.0+%2B+IDE%2FDebugger+%2B+WinAPI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac9259d62f1c986818e06d98bf40309648e7de14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,146,89,214,47,28,152,104,24,224,109,152,191,64,48,150,72,231,222,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
