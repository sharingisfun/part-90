They get split up and Hina ends up in a strange meeting with a man named Ikumi in a game arcade. The next day, Ikumi turns up as the new teacher at her school. Ikumi doesn't seem to recognize Hina but the wheels of fate are slowly moving to reunite them in what is a passionate story of forbidden love.\n\nOne of the main underlying themes of this drama is death. Another important theme is the struggle Hina and Ikumi have in trying to realize the difference between love and dependence... or is there a difference?\nNot a remake of the 1993 version; it takes place at the same school, but with different characters and situations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b68241cae46773ebc50dd8b763e4e34524c0bd19","amp;dn":"Kou+Kou+Kyoushi+2003","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b68241cae46773ebc50dd8b763e4e34524c0bd19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,130,65,202,228,103,115,235,197,13,216,183,99,228,227,69,36,192,189,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
