Agam's cello and ear-grabbing vocals meet head on with Mayhew's guitar licks and banjo picks as the pair's harmonies sail confidently overhead. While not particularly groundbreaking stylistically -- their songs often dig into a serious retro vibe -- The April Maze have both a special chemistry and sound that simply makes you want to hear more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93f8c43253d1f078694479df2b5af86bf19576fd","amp;dn":"The+April+Maze+-+The+April+Maze+%5B2014%5D+%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93f8c43253d1f078694479df2b5af86bf19576fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,248,196,50,83,209,240,120,105,68,121,223,43,90,248,107,241,149,118,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
