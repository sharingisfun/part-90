Sent to investigate a spate of robberies in rural Victoria, he soon discovers that World War II has changed even the most ordinary of places and people.\n\nAn ex-bomber pilot and former POW, Berlin is struggling to fit back in: grappling with post-traumatic stress disorder, the ghosts of his dead crew and his futile attempts to numb the pain.\n\nWhen Berlin travels to AlburyÃ¢â‚¬â€œWodonga to track down the gang behind the robberies, he suspects he's a problem cop being set up to fail. Taking a room at the Diggers Rest Hotel in Wodonga, he sets about solving a case that no one else can Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with the help of feisty, ambitious journalist Rebecca Green and rookie constable Rob Roberts, the only cop in town he can trust.\n\nThen the decapitated body of a young girl turns up in a back alley, and Berlin's investigations lead him ever further through layers of small-town fears, secrets and despair.\n\n\nBlack Wattle Creek (Charlie Berlin #2)\n\nIt's September 1957, two days before the VFL grand final, and Detective Sergeant Charlie Berlin, former bomber pilot and ex-POW, finally has some time off. But there's no rest for Charlie, a decent but damaged man still troubled by his wartime experiences. A recently widowed friend asks a favour and he's dropped into something a hell of a lot bigger than he bargained for when he discovers a Melbourne funeral parlour has been burying bodies with parts missing. A Hungarian ÃƒÂ©migrÃƒÂ© hearse driver points Berlin in the right direction but it quickly becomes obvious anyone asking the wrong questions is in real danger.\n\nWith his offsider beaten and left for dead, witnesses warned off, Special Branch on his case, and people he doesn't know watching his every move, Berlin realises even his young family may be in danger.\n\nHis pursuit of the truth leads him to Blackwattle Creek, once an asylum for the criminally insane and now a foreboding home to even darker evils. And if Berlin thought government machinations during World War II were devious, those of the Cold War leave them for dead.\n\nRichly evocative of the period , Blackwattle Creek is a rattling good tale with a dry wit and a sobering core. \n\n\nSt Kilda Blues (Charlie Berlin #3) \n\nA serial killer's work goes unnoticed until Detective Berlin is on the case in this third spine-tingling Charlie Berlin novel.\n\nIt's 1967, the summer of love, and in swinging Melbourne Detective Sergeant Charlie Berlin has been hauled out of exile in the Fraud Squad to investigate the disappearance of a teenage girl, the daughter of a powerful and politically connected property developer. As Berlin's inquiries uncover more missing girls he gets an uneasy feeling he may be dealing with the city's first serial killer.\n\nBerlin's investigation leads him through inner-city discothÃƒÂ¨ques, hip photographic studios, the emerging drug culture and into the seedy back streets of St Kilda. The investigation also brings up ghosts of Berlin's past as a bomber pilot and POW in Europe and disturbing memories of the casual murder of a young woman he witnessed on a snow-covered road in Poland in the war's dying days. As in war, some victories come at a terrible cost and Berlin will have to face an awful truth and endure an unimaginable loss before his investigation is over","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f0d8ab107a230b4173f007ecd5161ab42f65a22","amp;dn":"Geoff+McGeachin+-+Charlie+Berlin+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f0d8ab107a230b4173f007ecd5161ab42f65a22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,13,138,177,7,162,48,180,23,63,0,126,205,81,97,171,66,246,90,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
