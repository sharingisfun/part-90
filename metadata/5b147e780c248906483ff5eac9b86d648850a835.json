Hoping he would latch onto a new local music scene that would inspire him, Mills grew disappointed and eventually opted to return back home. Mills formed a group known as Pi, which besides an ill-advised arena tour opening for Robbie Williams, nothing came of. Mills moved on once more before the band could issue any recordings, and signed on with Kula ShakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former management company. Looking to return to Kula ShakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s psychedelic pop sound, Mills found like-minded musicians for his new project, namely Dan McKinna (bass) and Andy Nixon (drums), and took the word Jeevas (a derivation of the Indian term for Ã¢â‚¬Ëœlife forceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) as his new bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name. Recording sessions for their debut album took only three weeks in total (in a small studio owned by Pete Thomas of the Attractions), and resulted in a recording contract with Kula ShakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former label, Epic Records. JeevasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ debut, 1-2-3-4, was released in September 2002 and appeared to sink without a trace. Cowboys And Indians opened with the sparkling Ã¢â‚¬ËœBlack &amp; BlueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, but fell back into indifference with pointless cover versions of Creedence Clearwater RevivalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœHave You Ever Seen The RainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Bob DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœMasters Of WarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Mills is capable of so much more. \n\n \t1 \t\nBlack &amp; Blue\n\t\nThe Jeevas\n\t2:43 \t\n\t\t2 \t\nHave You Ever Seen the Rain\nJohn Fogerty\n\t\nThe Jeevas\n\t3:23 \t\n\t\t3 \t\nHealing Hands\n\t\nThe Jeevas\n\t3:39 \t\n\t\t4 \t\nThe Way You Carry On\n\t\nThe Jeevas\n\t3:39 \t\n\t\t5 \t\nI Can't Help Myself\n\t\nThe Jeevas\n\t3:17 \t\n\t\t6 \t\nBack Home\n\t\nThe Jeevas\n\t3:13 \t\n\t\t7 \t\nQue Pasa (Con Tu Culo)?\n\t\nThe Jeevas\n\t2:33 \t\n\t\t8 \t\nHow Much Do You Suck\n\t\nThe Jeevas\n\t2:33 \t\n\t\t9 \t\nMasters of War\nBob Dylan\n\t\nThe Jeevas\n\t6:07 \t\n\t\t10 \t\nStoned Love\n\t\nThe Jeevas\n\t4:50 \t\n\t\t11 \t\nGirl Without a Name\n\t\nThe Jeevas\n\t3:07 \t\n\t\t12 \t\nGood Man Down\n\t\nThe Jeevas\n\t4:44 \t\n\t\t13 \t\nRio Grande\n\t\nThe Jeevas\n\t15:19 \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b147e780c248906483ff5eac9b86d648850a835","amp;dn":"The+Jeevas-Cowboys+and+Indians","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b147e780c248906483ff5eac9b86d648850a835","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,20,126,120,12,36,137,6,72,63,245,234,201,184,109,100,136,80,168,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
