Her multiracial features set her apart from her well-intentioned white parents, who evaded questions about her past. But when Deborah discovered a letter revealing the truth--that she was born in prison to a heroin-addicted mother and spent the first year of her life there--she spiraled into emotional lockdown. For years she turned to drugs, violence, and crime as a way to cope with her grief. Ultimately, Deborah overcame the stigma, shame, and secrecy of her birth and found peace by helping others--proving that redemption and acceptance is possible, even from the darkest corners","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90451d219d8a353eec5c55bb269c455f95f3ed03","amp;dn":"Prison+Baby+-+Deborah+Jiang+Stein","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90451d219d8a353eec5c55bb269c455f95f3ed03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,69,29,33,157,138,53,62,236,92,85,187,38,156,69,95,149,243,237,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
