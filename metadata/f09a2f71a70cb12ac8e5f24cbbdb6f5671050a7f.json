He doesn't remember the phone\ngives him instant access to ten billion yen and a woman who can make his most\noutlandish requests a reality. He doesn't recall his connection to the ongoing\nmissile attacks terrorizing the Japanese people. Or the part he played in the sudden\ndisappearance of 20,000 shut-ins. He doesn't even remember he's supposed to save\nJapan and will be murdered if he fails.
