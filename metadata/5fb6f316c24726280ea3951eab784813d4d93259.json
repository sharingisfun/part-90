He has to put his wild days behind him and do what fathers do best: be responsible. He is too rebellious. He is too wild. He is going to try &quot;just one more raid&quot; on the three nastiest, meanest farmers that are Boggis, Bunce and Bean. It is a tale of crossing the line of family responsibilities and midnight adventure and the friendships and awakenings of this country life that is inhabited by Fantastic Mr. Fox and his friends.\n\nCast\n\nCast overview, first billed only: \nGeorge Clooney  George Clooney   ...  \nMr. Fox (voice) \n \nMeryl Streep  Meryl Streep   ...  \nMrs. Fox (voice) \n \nJason Schwartzman  Jason Schwartzman   ...  \nAsh (voice) \n \nBill Murray  Bill Murray   ...  \nBadger (voice) \n \nWallace Wolodarsky  Wallace Wolodarsky   ...  \nKylie (voice) (as Wally Wolodarsky) \n \nEric Chase Anderson  Eric Chase Anderson   ...  \nKristofferson (voice) (as Eric Anderson) \n \nMichael Gambon  Michael Gambon   ...  \nFranklin Bean (voice) \n \nWillem Dafoe  Willem Dafoe   ...  \nRat (voice) \n \nOwen Wilson  Owen Wilson   ...  \nCoach Skip (voice) \n \nJarvis Cocker  Jarvis Cocker   ...  \nPetey (voice) \n \nWes Anderson  Wes Anderson   ...  \nWeasel (voice) \n \nKaren Duffy  Karen Duffy   ...  \nLinda Otter (voice) \n \nRobin Hurlstone  Robin Hurlstone   ...  \nWalter Boggis (voice) \n \nHugo Guinness  Hugo Guinness   ...  \nNathan Bunce (voice) \n \nHelen McCrory  Helen McCrory   ...  \nMrs. Bean (voice)  \n\n\nSex &amp; Nudity \n\n EditHistory \n\n\n1/10\n\nTwo non-graphic mentions of pregnancy. Reference to Mrs. Fox being the &quot;town tart&quot; in her youth. \n\n\n\n\nViolence &amp; Gore \n\n EditHistory \n\n\n2/10\n\nFarmers use guns frequently, but there is no blood.\n\nWhen Mr. Fox's tail is shot off, however, the end of it that was attached to his body is red.\n\nComical fighting is shown. There are two scenes in which characters claw at other characters, leaving deep scratches, but no blood.\n\n\n\nAnimals are electrocuted by an electric fence, but no one is hurt.\n\nMr. Fox kills chickens with his teeth. There is a reference to how grisly and bloody the process is, but it is an over-exaggeration and meant for humorous purposes, complete with comical discretion shots. \n\n\n\n\nProfanity \n\n EditHistory \n\n\n2/10\n\nInstead of using profanity, characters say sentences that would contain a swear word (especially the F word), but the word is replaced by the word &quot;cuss&quot; as a running joke. Some examples include &quot;You scared the cuss out of us,&quot; &quot;Don't you cuss with me,&quot; &quot;What the cuss,&quot; and &quot;cluster cuss.&quot; \n\n\n\n\nAlcohol/Drugs/Smoking \n\n EditHistory \n\n\nFranklin Bean is seen smoking a cigarette every time he appears. Bean also keeps a cellar full of hard apple cider, very alcoholic, which Mr. Fox steals along with Boggis and Bunce's chickens. The animals also drink the alcoholic cider. On one occasion, Mr. Fox is seen smoking a pipe. \n\n\n\n\nFrightening/Intense Scenes \n\n EditHistory \n\n\nThe fight between Mr. Fox and Rat inside an electric generator room underground may be considered intense. Most of the scene is in darkness, but brief moments of their fight are lit up by the crackling electricity. (Violent sounds may be heard.)\n\nThis picture is suitable to those age 7+.\n\n\n\n\n\n Rated PG for: Adult Content, Mild Violence.(HBO advisory) \n\n\nRuntime  1 hr 27 min (87 min)  \nSound Mix  DTS | SDDS | Dolby Digital  \nColor  Color  \nAspect Ratio  1.85 : 1  \nCamera  Nikon D3, Nikon and Cooke Varotal Lenses  \nLaboratory  DeLuxe, Hollywood (CA), USA (prints) \n Technicolor Creative Services, London, UK (digital intermediate)  \nFilm Length  2,367 m (Sweden)  \nNegative Format  Digital  \nCinematographic Process  Digital Intermediate (2K) (master format) \n Digital Stills (source format)  \nPrinted Film Format  35 mm (spherical) (Fuji Eterna-CP 3513DI) \n D-Cinema  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fb6f316c24726280ea3951eab784813d4d93259","amp;dn":"Fantastic+Mr+Fox","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fb6f316c24726280ea3951eab784813d4d93259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,182,243,22,194,71,38,40,14,163,149,30,171,120,72,19,212,217,50,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
