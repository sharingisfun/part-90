Jack, however, has not been making progress fast enough for Dr. Kendall's sponsor, Dr. Peabody, who has cut off his funding and sold Jack to a medical research lab. Afraid of what could happen to his simian friend, Dr. Kendall sneaks Jack out of his home in the lab; however, Jack is accidentally sent to Canada, where he gets loose and is discovered by Tara, a deaf girl who recognizes Jack's sign language. Jack has an even bigger surprise for Tara's older brother Steven; Jack scrambles onto the ice in the midst of practice for Steven's junior league hockey team, and he and his teammates discover the monkey has a natural talent for the game. With Jack on the team, Steven's team is on their way to a league championship, but Jack's notoriety attracts the unfortunate attention of Dr. Peabody, who are determined to send Jack back to his new owners.[/b]\n[/quote]\n\n\n[quote=Trailer]\n\n[/quote]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8cadde1eb7934936eeb170a5e04a681c4b4b7ff","amp;dn":"MVP.Most.Valuable.Primate.2000.iNTERNAL.DVDRip.XViD-MULTiPLY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8cadde1eb7934936eeb170a5e04a681c4b4b7ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,202,221,225,235,121,52,147,110,235,23,10,94,4,166,129,196,180,183,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
