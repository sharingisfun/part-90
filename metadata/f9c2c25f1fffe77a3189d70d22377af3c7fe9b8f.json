It is said that if Jimmy Smith was the Charlie Parker of jazz organ, Larry Young was its John Coltrane.\n\nContrastst is sometimes quite intense but also grooves.\n\n\nTracklisting:\n01.

The adventurous music is sometimes quite intense but also grooves in its own eccentric way, offering listeners a very fresh sound on organ.\n\n--------\n\nYou might have seen my other Larry Young compilation here at The Pirate Bay: \n&quot;Larry Young - 12 Albums - Jazz Organ&quot;\n\nL Hammond, The Pirate Bay, where you'll find more jazz organ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9c2c25f1fffe77a3189d70d22377af3c7fe9b8f","amp;dn":"Larry+Young+-+Contrasts+-+Jazz+Organ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9c2c25f1fffe77a3189d70d22377af3c7fe9b8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,194,194,95,31,255,231,122,49,137,215,13,34,55,122,243,199,254,155,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
