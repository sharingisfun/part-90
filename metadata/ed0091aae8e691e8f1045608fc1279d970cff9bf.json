Elephant Sound graciously presents eleven sweeping instrumentals that escalate with a kind of of New Age space-movie buildup. &quot;Mission To The Moog&quot; is a postmodern hip-hop floor trembler, which features bitchen samples from Mission Control and Neil Armstrong on his Apollo 11 journey a la the old Nels Peterson All-Star sample orgies. More journeys into the unknown include the obscure but ultimately mesmerizing &quot;Dog In The Piano,&quot; with silly lyrics and more than a little Tipper Gore-infuriating morphology. Other choice moments include the sparkly &quot;Chairman Of The Board&quot; and the brittler, poppier &quot;Your Own Enemy,&quot; which brings new techno oomph to a genre that has threatened to flatten out and die of late. Released as a single, &quot;66 Metres&quot; features the freakish banshee vocals of Shahin Badar, last heard on &quot;Smack My Bitch Up.&quot; Brighton-based production swami Sanj Sen is the button-man behind all this unchecked fun, managing to make a record that combines the most agreeable moments of The Prodigy and Fatboy Slim in a single sleeve to be proud of.\n\nSkint Records\n-------------\n\nHome to Fatboy Slim, Sonny Wharton, X-Press 2, Paolo Mojo, Freq Nasty, Midfield General, Kidda, Tim Deluxe, Lo-Fidelity Allstars and the Space Raiders. Both &quot;Skint&quot; (label name) and &quot;Brassic&quot; (in the album cat numbers) are UK slang words meaning broke or penniless - the opposite to parent label Loaded. \n\nAlbum debut: 24th May 1999\n\nTracklist\n\n1 \tChairman Of The Board                       3:11\n2 \tIndian Ropeman                              5:08\n3 \tStand Clear                                 5:48\n4\tSunshine Of Your Love                       5:23\n5 \tDo Not Deviate From Your Present Course     3:10\n6 \tYour Own Enemy                              6:56\n7 \t66 Meters\n           Featuring Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Shahin Badar                 9:02\n8 \tDog In The Piano (Pub Rok Mix)              5:41\n9 \tMission To The Moog Pt.I                    3:35\n10 \tDominant Tonic                              6:05\n11 \tMission To The Moog Pt.II                   5:15\n\nBitrate: Variable, 128kbps-320kbps\nFormat: MP3\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed0091aae8e691e8f1045608fc1279d970cff9bf","amp;dn":"Indian+Ropeman+-+Elephantsound","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed0091aae8e691e8f1045608fc1279d970cff9bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,0,145,170,232,230,145,232,241,4,86,8,252,18,121,217,112,207,249,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
