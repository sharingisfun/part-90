It uses a x64 LivePE allowing it to be installed to UEFI and it also lets you pre select the applications/games/tweaks from the LivePE prior to installing the OS (this is the only OS mod that allows you to pick everything at the start and walk away until it's ready at the desktop). You can also boot to the LivePE to repair or backup/image a broken OS/PC.\n\n* Note: This OS has had the NaturalLanguage component removed as well as a few printer drivers, but is otherwise complete (Windows 10 will suit NaturalLanguage users better than 8, so time to remove it from all future 8 mods IMHO):-\n\nApart from the remove component I reduced the size of this release by capturing with sysprep a clean OS with it's updates fully applied, I then reset it's base (unable to remove updates) removing over 910MB and then compressed install.wim to .esd to make it 800mb smaller again. I also only included the essential apps that every OS install needs as the rest can be grabbed from my previous AwakenOS v8.1.1 release (warez) or updated Freeware ones on our Application Repository. So this is a semi Lite OS with the install.esd weighing in at 2.16GB making the whole release under 4GB to download.\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s824.photobucket.com/user/LiveFreeDead/library/AwakenOS?sort=9&amp;page=1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s824.photobucket.com/user/LiveFreeDead/library/AwakenOS?sort=9&amp;page=1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*Default Password is &quot;password&quot;\n\nEnable_Windows_Defender.reg\n----------\nWindows Registry Editor Version 5.00\n\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREPoliciesMicrosoftWindows Defender] \n&quot;DisableAntiSpyware&quot;=dword:00000000 \n\n\n[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodePoliciesMicrosoftWindows Defender] \n&quot;DisableAntiSpyware&quot;=dword:00000000 \n[HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionGroup Policy Objects{CF9298EA-95FF-4D76-9BFE-6F023010C1C8}MachineSoftwarePoliciesMicrosoftWindows Defender] \n&quot;DisableAntiSpyware&quot;=dword:00000000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00aaf6bbc7889655121caa5b70a86af97d229ec8","amp;dn":"AwakenOS+v8.1.3+x64+ReturnOfNights","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00aaf6bbc7889655121caa5b70a86af97d229ec8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,170,246,187,199,136,150,85,18,28,170,91,112,168,106,249,125,34,158,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
