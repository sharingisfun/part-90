Some songs of the album arose from collaborations (Featuring / Remix) with artists outside of germany, for example electronic singer/songwriter Fifi Rong (London) or instrumental Post-Rock artist James Hrabak (Chicago). Their energetic 'wall of sound' includes distorted piano, noisy guitars, bittersweet vocal melodies, and solemn string passages - landing them somewhere between Placebo, Sigur Ros and Radiohead. \n\nQuality: 128kbps\n\nDownloaded from bandcamp\n\nEnjoy! ;-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff9a5c85ba000adfa7d0221d9757070ef9c02574","amp;dn":"Ewian+-+Good+Old+Underground+%5B2014%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff9a5c85ba000adfa7d0221d9757070ef9c02574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,154,92,133,186,0,10,223,167,208,34,29,151,87,7,14,249,192,37,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
