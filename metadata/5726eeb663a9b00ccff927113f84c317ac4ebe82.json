FOX really doesn't give a shit about this show.\nThey're airing it out of order (Check the production numbers) and our internal was missing dialogue for over 20s, we have safe guards to detect drops in audio but since the background audio kept going it went undetected.\nWe just checked the entire season and luckily these drops are only present in E07.\n\nIMMERSE has various drops throughout we didn't keep track of them all, the last one we detected was /\nEg. 35m7s missing two words from the start of the segment, missing a few frames and then the frames that do come through are under-cropped\nAs much as we love dishing out the hate, this is a issue with FOX not IMMERSE.\nAlthough their release drifts 120ms out of sync at the start of various segments then magically recovers? wtf?...\nAndddddd it's poorly encoded garbage with a low-bitrate and massive detail loss...\n\nBackstrom.S01E07.720p.HDTV.x264-IMMERSE @ 1.20GiB @ 3520 Kbps\nBackstrom.S01E07.PROPER.720p.HDTV.x264-BATV @ 1.65 GiB @ 5006 Kbps\n*Cough* Missing footage?
