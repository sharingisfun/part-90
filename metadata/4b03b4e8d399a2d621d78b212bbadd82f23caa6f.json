When Ida gives birth to a baby boy, she claims the preacher is the baby' s father. After Ida is convicted of negligent homicide and goes to prison, Mavis finds herself faced with the task of raising Ida' s six-year-old daughter, Tia. Mavis barely knows her grandchild, and must find a way to form a bond while she' s still struggling with her husband' s betrayal. Tia has already spent time with an abusive foster parent, and now must learn to survive with her emotionally distant grandmother. Catherine Flowers brings readers the powerful story of three generations of women who must come to terms with the past and learn how to forgive one another if there is any hope of healing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b03b4e8d399a2d621d78b212bbadd82f23caa6f","amp;dn":"Catherine+Flowers-Yesterday%27s+Eyes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b03b4e8d399a2d621d78b212bbadd82f23caa6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,3,180,232,211,153,162,214,33,215,139,33,43,186,221,130,242,60,170,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
