Basically, it's funky grooves done almost entirely with only bass and drum machines, courtesy of Andrew Weiss, with Rollins being ... well, being Rollins. That means if you can't handle Henry's angry rants, then you will find this to be a boring listen. BUT if you either ignore or enjoy Rollins' style, then the music truly stands on its own. Andrew Weiss is a powerful bassist who really knows how to groove, and these songs are funky, loud, and in your face. He gets so many different sounds from his bass that the recordings sound full; some excellent sampling completes the package (examples: Ted Nugent's live stage banter, and the guitar solo from More Than A Feeling).\n\nI still can't believe this was released on Chysalis. What that major label thought it could do with this very unusual set of recordings is beyond me. It probably only sold a few thousand copies. I got mine in a used bin for 2 bucks! But it would have been worth it for a lot more than that. This ep KICKS A$$.[/quote]\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Wartime - Fast Food for Thought (Chrysalis F2 21753)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Wartime\nAlbum................: Fast Food for Thought (Chrysalis F2 21753)\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1990\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 101 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
