The phrase &quot;I got a rocket in my pocket&quot; is sufficient in fact as review. You know even all exactly what you get.\n\nThis Norwegian hard rock band was founded in 2006 and now has three plates in his pocket. \nThe most recent achievement listens as saying to the name 'Fuel To Burn'. Do not expect innovative music.\n \nSpitfire received a multitude of unadulterated hard rock in the line of Van Halen and Danko Jones. \nThe Scandinavian quartet knows what a good song must meet and that has resulted in a strong album. \n'Fuel To Burn' contains chunky riffs, catchy choruses and strong hooks. The songs linger and are all very catchy.\n \nAt its core, this is pop music, but includes screaming and abrasive guitars. \nThanks to a clear production, all the tools to their fullest. Yet this record has a sleazy edge. \nIt sounds namely just some vicious and dirtier than you're used to the genre.\n\n\nTracklist\n\n01. Fuel To Burn\n02. Damned If You Do\n03. Dogfight\n04. Nightmare\n05. Far Away\n06. Gimme Some\n07. I\n08. Down\n\n\n\nPlayers\n\nJan Tore Befring: Vocals\n\nBjÃƒÂ¸rn ÃƒËœ. Berge: Guitar\n\nSveinung Igland: Bass, Vocals\n\nOle Nic. LÃƒÂ¸bÃƒÂ¸: Drum\n\n\nAs normal go to the shows and buy the merch,thats the best way to support the artist, all of that money goes to the band.
