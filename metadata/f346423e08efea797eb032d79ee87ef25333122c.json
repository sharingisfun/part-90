They dissolved in 2001, but reunited from 2005 to 2007 for a few festival dates and brief US tours, and will once again be reuniting in 2014. The group was founded by Ihsahn (guitar/vocals) and Samoth (then, drums).\n\n\nIn the Nightside Eclipse is the first studio album and fourth official release by Norwegian black metal band Emperor, released in 1994 through Candlelight Records. It was the last album to feature drummer Faust and the only one to feature one-time bassist Tchort. Considered a landmark in the black metal scene, the album has been ranked by critics as one of the most influential albums of the genre. It also contains one of Emperor's best known tracks, &quot;I Am the Black Wizards&quot;.\n\nIn his review, Steve Huey of AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five, writing, &quot;In the Nightside Eclipse resoundingly demonstrated that there was real musical substance and ambition in the world of black metal. [...] [it] somehow managed to capture the essence of the genre while completely rewriting its rule book&quot;, commenting that it was also &quot;the first [album] to fuse black metal with progressive and symphonic elements, setting the stage for a bevy of future experimentation in the genre, [...] As such, it certainly possesses the farthest-reaching legacy of anything from Norway's bloody first wave, and ranks as one of the most important heavy metal albums of the '90s.&quot; In 2005, the album was ranked number 292 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time.\n\nBANDMEMBERS:\n\nIhsahn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, guitar, keyboard, mastering, production\nSamoth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, mastering, production\nFaust Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\nTchort Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\nDisc 1 - In The Nightside Eclipse (Remastered)\n\n01 Introduction 0:51\n02 Into The Infinity Of Thoughts 8:15\n03 The Burning Shadows Of Silence 5:35\n04 Cosmic Keys To My Creations &amp; Times 6:06\n05 Beyond The Great Vast Forest 6:01\n06 Towards The Pantheon 5:58\n07 The Majesty Of The Nightsky 4:53\n08 I Am The Black Wizards 6:00\n09 Inno A Satana 4:49\n\nAs The Shadows Rise 7&quot; EP 1994 (Remastered)\n\n10 The Ancient Queen 3:41\n11 Witches Sabbath 5:55\n12 Lord Of The Storms 1:57\n\nDisc 2 - In The Nightside Eclipse, Alternative Mix 1993 (Previously Unreleased)\n\n01 Introduction (Alternative Mix 1993) 0:51\n02 Into The Infinity Of Thoughts (Alternative Mix 1993) 8:14\n03 The Burning Shadows Of Silence (Alternative Mix 1993) 5:35\n04 Cosmic Keys To My Creations &amp; Times (Alternative Mix 1993) 6:03\n05 Beyond The Great Vast Forest (Alternative Mix 1993) 5:59\n06 Towards The Pantheon (Alternative Mix 1993) 5:58\n07 The Majesty Of The Nightsky (Alternative Mix 1993) 4:49\n08 I Am The Black Wizards (Alternative Mix 1993) 6:02\n09 Inno A Satana (Alternative Mix 1993) 4:49\n\n\n\n\nThe Akkerhaugen Tapes 1993 (Previously Unreleased)\n\n10 The Majesty Of The Nightsky (4-Track Pre-Prod. 1993) 5:03\n11 The Burning Shadows Of Silence (Pre-Prod.
