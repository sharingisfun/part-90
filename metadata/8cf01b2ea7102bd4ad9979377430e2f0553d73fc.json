All they have is their own\ningenuity, miles of endless water, paralyzing fear, loneliness and isolation\nthat comes from facing your own mortality. Can they last at sea until they hit\nland? Or will extreme conditions cause them to surrender? With this extreme\nphysical and mental challenge, it's not only their own survival they have to\nendure, but each other. If one wants to quit, the adventure is over for the\nboth of them.
