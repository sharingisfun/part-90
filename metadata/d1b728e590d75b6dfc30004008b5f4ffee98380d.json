William Gurstelle, author of the bestselling Backyard Ballistics and frequent contributor to Popular Mechanics and Make magazine, presents 25 projects with instructions, diagrams, photos, and links to video demonstrations that enable people of all ages (including young enthusiasts with proper supervision) to explore and safely play with fire.\n\nFrom FranklinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stove to DieselÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s engine, Gurstelle tells the explosive and fascinating tales of the great American and European pyromaniacs who scientifically revealed the mysteries of fire. Among them are hot-headed &quot;Gunpowder&quot; Joseph Priestley, who discovered oxygen, and Antoine Lavoisier, the father of chemistry who lost his head on the guillotine, as well as scientist and spy Count Rumford and dapper Humphrey Davy whose chemical discoveries and fiery inventions saved thousands of lives.\n\nWith The Practical Pyromaniac in hand readers can replicate these breakthrough scientistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ experiments and inventions, from the simply fascinating one-candle-power engine to the nearly magical fire piston and from a practical backpacker stove to an incredible tornado of fire.\n\n\n\nBy William Gurstelle\nPublished by Chicago Review Press in 2011\nEPUB, Retail, 224 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1b728e590d75b6dfc30004008b5f4ffee98380d","amp;dn":"The+Practical+Pyromaniac+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1b728e590d75b6dfc30004008b5f4ffee98380d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,183,40,229,144,215,91,109,252,48,0,64,8,181,244,255,238,152,56,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
