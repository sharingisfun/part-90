That first solo outing solidified her as more that just a vocalist for Massive Attack, earining her awards and accolades for her writing ability. \nThis follow up didn't recieve the attention that &quot;Silence&quot; did. It's a shame because it is just as promising, if not more-so than it's predecessor, continuing with the fluid string arrangements, bits of mowtown, urban beats, jazz inflections, abstract, and better production from the likes of Jah Wobble, Tim Simenon(Bomb the Bass), St. Etienne, Pressure Drop and Lucas to name a few.
