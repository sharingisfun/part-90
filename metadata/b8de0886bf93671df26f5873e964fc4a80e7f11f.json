The film deals with the charged emotional tensions of a group of pubescent boys, who find their sexual urges stifled by the school's oppressive atmosphere. Depicting the chaste lifestyle of the religious functionaries, the burgeoning sexual desires of the young men are bottled up until they are ready to explode.\n\n\nFormat: PAL\n\n\n\n\nAspect Ratio: 16:9\n\n\n\n\nRuntime:1 Hour 34 Minutes 58 Seconds\n\n\n\n\n\nDisk Region: ALL REGIONS\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's most honoured film! \n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074404/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074404/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8de0886bf93671df26f5873e964fc4a80e7f11f","amp;dn":"+The+Devil%27s+Playground+%281976%29+DVD9+RETAIL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8de0886bf93671df26f5873e964fc4a80e7f11f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,222,8,134,191,147,103,29,242,111,88,115,233,100,252,74,128,231,241,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
