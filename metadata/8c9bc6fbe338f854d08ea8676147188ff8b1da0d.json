Stuffed into a bottle and sold by a slave trader, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now in hiding on the dark caravan, the lucrative jinni slave trade between Arjinna and Earth, where jinn are forced to grant wishes and obey their human mastersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ every command. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d give almost anything to be free of the golden shackles that bind her to Malek, her handsome, cruel master, and his lavish Hollywood lifestyle.\n\nEnter Raif, the enigmatic leader of ArjinnaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revolution and NaliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sworn enemy. He promises to free Nalia from her master so that she can return to her ravaged homeland and free her imprisoned brotherÃ¢â‚¬â€all for an unbearably high price. NaliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not sure she can trust him, but RaifÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s her only hope of escape. With her enemies on the hunt, Earth has become more perilous than ever for Nalia. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just one catch: for RaifÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unbinding magic to work, Nalia must gain possession of her bottleÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and convince the dangerously persuasive Malek that she truly loves him. Battling a dark past and harboring a terrible secret, Nalia soon realizes her freedom may come at a price too terrible to pay: but how far is she willing to go for it?\n\nInspired by Arabian Nights, EXQUISITE CAPTIVE brings to life a deliciously seductive world where a wish can be a curse and shadows are sometimes safer than the light","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c9bc6fbe338f854d08ea8676147188ff8b1da0d","amp;dn":"Exquisite+Captive+%5BDark+Caravan+Cycle%2C+%2301%5D+-+Heather+Demetrios","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c9bc6fbe338f854d08ea8676147188ff8b1da0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,155,198,251,227,56,248,84,208,142,168,103,97,71,24,143,248,177,218,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
