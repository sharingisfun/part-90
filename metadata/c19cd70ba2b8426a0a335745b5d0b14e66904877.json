Many of these successes were\nunconventional, showcasing a daring A&amp;R vision held by Sam Charters and Maynard\nSolomon, amongst others. Yet, alongside the label's hits, these early\n  visionaries\nsigned, produced and released other challenging and genre-pushing records that\ncame and went without a whimper or a prayer.\n\nCharters and Vanguard scouted the cutting edge (and at times the\n  cutting-cutting-\nedge)\nof music from the greatest counter-cultural scenes of 1960s America. From the\n  East\nVillage of New York to the Jabberwocky crazed-folk of Berkeley and the\n  auto-factory\nclang and chop of Detroit, Vanguard schizophrenically strove to present to its\naudience new sounds and new grooves. And while the wild experimentation of John\nFahey's ÃƒÂ´RequiaÃƒÂ¶ and the crazed jams of Country Joe are still beloved by\n  audiences\nand readily available, those records present only a small part of the story.\n\nThis compilation marks the first time the Vanguard label has gone through its\narchives\nto hand-select tracks from their best ÃƒÂ´lostÃƒÂ¶ records and 45s. Many of the bands\nfeatured here only released one record, or a smattering of singles, before\n  drifting\ninto obscurity, although many of the artists went on to greater fame after their\nstint at Vanguard was done. And while they are stylistically varied, there lies\n  a\ncommon thread of musical proficiency and integrity that represents the trademark\nof quality Vanguard strived to upholdÃƒÂ no matter how bombastic, fuzz-soaked or\nouter-worldly the music may have seemed.\n\nUltimately, this record isn't about digging for ÃƒÂ´NuggetsÃƒÂ¶ or ÃƒÂ´PebblesÃƒÂ¶, but\n  rather\nabout mining gems from the Vanguard vaults. I invite you to ÃƒÂ´Follow Me DownÃƒÂ¶ and\ndiscover the treasures that have emerged from the excavation. I assure you that\nyou won't be disappointed.\n\n#   track          length\n\n01  The Third Power - Getting  04:22\n02  Erik - You Said/But I've G 05:48\n03  Listening - Stoned Is      04:43\n04  The 31st Of February - A N 04:24\n05  Elizabeth - You Should Be  04:06\n06  Jeff Monn - I Can Understa 02:28\n07  Listening - See You Again  03:46\n08  Circus Maximus - Travelin' 04:00\n09  The Frost - Take My Hand   04:23\n10  Notes From The Underground 03:01\n11  The Vagrants - I Can't Mak 02:35\n12  The Serpent Power - The En 13:16\n13  The Family Of Apostolic -  02:25\n14  The Third Power - Persecut 03:27\n15  Notes From The Underground 02:42\n16  The Hi-Five - Did You Have 03:08\n17  The Far Cry - Hellhound    03:44\n18  The Frost - Big Time Spend 04:32","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c19cd70ba2b8426a0a335745b5d0b14e66904877","amp;dn":"VA-Follow_Me_Down_Vanguards_Lost_Psychedelic_Era_%281966-1970%29-201","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c19cd70ba2b8426a0a335745b5d0b14e66904877","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,156,215,11,162,184,66,106,10,51,87,69,181,208,177,78,102,144,72,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
