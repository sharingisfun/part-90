In the first episode, they are taken to a forest in a remote\narea of Bulgaria where archaeologist and survival expert Klint Janulis\nintroduces them to their new home a Mesolithic style camp supplied with basic\ntools, rations, a pile of flint and a freshly killed deer. With only hours\nbefore nightfall, the tribe has to preserve as much food as possible, dig\nlatrines and build a fire.\n\n                                 Enjoy!\n\n  Greetings To: aAF BARGE BiA FTP FoV HAGGiS RiVER SomeTV TASTETV WATERS \n\n     We are currently looking for:\n     * US/UK cappers with HDTV/PDTV/DSR feed (1Mbit+ Upload Speed)\n     * Legit .EU 100MBit+ sites to affil (no rented/colo/leaseweb)\n\n               E-mail enquires to","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:455c2717284ca37049bcdbaf22be1c4b45749641","amp;dn":"10000.BC.S01E01.PDTV.x264-C4TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"455c2717284ca37049bcdbaf22be1c4b45749641","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,92,39,23,40,76,163,112,73,188,219,175,34,190,28,75,69,116,150,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
