TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had many line-up changes around the two key members, Corey Bing and Bahb Branca and had disbanded shortly after the split with Burmese in 2004. Since returning in 2006 with the Ã¢â‚¬ËœFor a Better TomorrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ EP, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve put out numerous albums, EPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and split releases.\n&quot;Some heavy metal &quot;rock&quot; groups extol the virtues of drugs, and kids Ã¢â‚¬ËœworshipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ these people.&quot; -sample leading off Vermin Prolificus, the billionth record oozing out from Fistula, who I'm now convinced are the reason why Cleveland is so goddamned dirty.\n\nFUCK this album crushes!! UGHHHH!!\n\nPardon the paroxysm, but I may have just discovered a new favourite band. Until I received this album in my box I had only heard of these guys in passing, which blows me away considering how neatly they fit into my own personal taste (not to mention their sheer volume of output over the last 15-odd years. Seriously, 20 something releases since 98?? How did I miss this?! I almost feel like apologizing to the band.).\n\n\n2014 Vermin Prolificus\n\nTracklist:\n\n1).
