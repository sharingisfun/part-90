Their latest EP, titled Gasping For Air, represents what is probably the most fully formed of their recordings yet. Initially a solo project of front man, Mark Boniface, Harker have recruited a full band for their latest songs which offer up soaring melodies and heartfelt stories of personal relationships and striving to create a living from your passions.\n\nThe title track Ã¢â‚¬Å“Gasping for AirÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ deals with this topic in depth, as singer Mark explains Ã¢â‚¬Å“the song is about how growing up playing music implants a mindset into your brain where you can no longer adapt to a normal working existence. As soon as a tiny insight of this feeling looms over me I panic, as the last thing I want to do is be trapped in my own little existence, repeating the same day until iÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m in the ground.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:116539d6eabe2fcf87ef46a8c6c1f205f6ed11b3","amp;dn":"Harker+-+Gasping+For+Air","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"116539d6eabe2fcf87ef46a8c6c1f205f6ed11b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,101,57,214,234,190,47,207,135,239,70,168,198,193,242,5,246,237,17,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
