He was known primarily for playing in the bebop, hard bop and post-bop styles from the early 1960s and on. His unmistakable and influential tone contributed to new perspectives for modern jazz and bebop.\n\nHubbard was one of the liveliest of the young hard-bop lions of the late Ã¢â‚¬â„¢50s and early Ã¢â‚¬â„¢60s. As a Jazz Messenger, and with his own early albums for Blue Note, he set down so many great solos that trumpeters have made studies of him to this day, the burnished tone, bravura phrasing and rhythmical subtleties still enduringly modern. He never quite had the quickfire genius of Lee Morgan, but he had a greater all-round strength, and he is an essential player in the theatre of hard bop. He first worked, back home in Indianapolis, with the Montgomery brothers and arrived in New York in 1959. He joined the Jazz Messengers in 1961 and was involved in important recordings with Ornette Coleman and Oliver Nelson, as well as leading his own dates. Uncertain of his direction in the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢70s, and unable to play at all in the later Ã¢â‚¬â„¢90s because of lip trouble.\nHis several Blue Note dates seem to come and go in the catalogue. Open Sesame and GoinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Up were his first two records for the label and their youthful ebullience is still exhilarating, the trumpeter throwing off dazzling phrases almost for the sheer fun of it. The brio of the debut is paired with the sense that this was the important coming-out of a major talent, and HubbardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solo on the title-track is a remarkable piece of brinkmanship: in the bonus alternative take, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a shade cooler, but that more tempered effort is less exciting, too. Ã¢â‚¬ËœAll Or Nothing At AllÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is taken at a pace that suggests the Indianapolis 500; power, but you feel he could play like this all night. This was an early appearance for Tyner, and a valuable glimpse of Tina Brooks, who contributes two tunes and plays with his particular mix of elegance and fractious temper. A great Blue Note set.\n\nHDTracks-PCM-24Bit-96Khz.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99251b1831bd685e220f6650a62a74aff2f91b9f","amp;dn":"Freddie+Hubbard+-+Open+Sesame+%281960%29+2011+HDTracks+24-96-FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99251b1831bd685e220f6650a62a74aff2f91b9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,37,27,24,49,189,104,94,34,15,102,80,166,42,116,175,242,249,27,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
