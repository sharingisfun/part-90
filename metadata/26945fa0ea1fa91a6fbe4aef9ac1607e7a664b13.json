Groucho Marx plays God, a drug dealer who must live on a yacht, hidden in the ocean. There's another guy who is in jail, who has everything and deals from jail. \n\nJackie, from the encouragement of God, goes to jail so that he can find and kill the other guy. In jail, Jackie by mistake swallows some LSD. \nHilarity ensues. \n\nIt is of surprisingly good (OK) quality, compared to the other copies available as torrents. \nThis replaces my other copy, that I lost. It is from another computer, same movie. \n\nOtto Preminger was the director.\n\nPlease remember to seed, if it doesn't cost you anything to do so. Thanks.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26945fa0ea1fa91a6fbe4aef9ac1607e7a664b13","amp;dn":"Skidoo+%281968%29+-+Otto+Preminger+%28Good+Quality%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26945fa0ea1fa91a6fbe4aef9ac1607e7a664b13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,148,95,160,234,31,169,26,111,190,74,239,154,193,96,126,122,102,75,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
