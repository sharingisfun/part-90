The band evolved from an earlier group called The Iveys that was formed in 1961 by Ham, Ron Griffiths and David &quot;Dai&quot; Jenkins in Swansea, Wales. They were signed by the Beatles' Apple label in 1968 as The Iveys. In 1969, Griffiths left and was replaced by Joey Molland, and the band renamed itself Badfinger. In 1970, the band engaged American businessman Stan Polley to manage their commercial affairs. Over the next five years the band recorded several albums for Apple and toured extensively, before they became embroiled in the chaos of Apple Records' dissolution.\n\nBadfinger had four consecutive worldwide hits from 1970 to 1972: &quot;Come and Get It&quot; (written and produced by Paul McCartney), &quot;No Matter What&quot;, &quot;Day After Day&quot; (produced by George Harrison) and &quot;Baby Blue&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Baby Blue&quot; made a resurgence onto the &quot;Hot Rock Songs&quot; Billboard 100 chart at number 14, due to its featuring at the end of the series finale of the hit TV show Breaking Bad. Their song &quot;Without You&quot; has been covered many times, including a Billboard number one hit for Harry Nilsson.\n\nThey signed to Warner Bros., but Polley's financial machinations resulted in a lawsuit by Warner over missing escrow account money. Warner's consequent withdrawal from market of the 1974 album, Wish You Were Here (seven weeks after its release), cut off the band's income. Three days before his 28th birthday, on 24 April 1975, Ham committed suicide by hanging himself, leaving a note that included damning comments about Polley.\n\nOver the next three years, surviving members struggled to rebuild their personal and professional lives against a backdrop of lawsuits. The albums Airwaves (1978) and Say No More (1981) floundered, as Molland and Evans see-sawed between co-operation and struggle in attempts to revive and capitalise on the Badfinger legacy. Having seen Ham's body after Ham's wife had called him, Evans reportedly never got over his friend's suicide, and was quoted as saying in darker moments, &quot;I wanna be where he is.&quot; On 19 November 1983, Evans also took his own life by hanging.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAirwaves is an album released by British rock band Badfinger in 1979 on the Elektra label (a sister label to Warner Bros. Records, their previous label), the seventh album released that was credited to Badfinger. Anticipated as a comeback album for the group at the time, expectations were not quite realized, as the &quot;group&quot; now consisted of just the duo of Tom Evans and Joey Molland, accompanied by guitarist Joe Tansin and various session musicians.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPersonnel And Credits:\nAs listed in liner notes of 1999 re-issue.\n\n1.&quot;Airwaves&quot; Words and music: Joey Molland and Tom Evans\nLead vocal: Tom Evans\nAcoustic guitar: Joey Molland\nLeg, hands and feet: Peter Clark\n\n2.&quot;Look Out California&quot; Words and music: Tom Evans\nLead vocal: Tom Evans\nHarmonies: Tom Evans and David Malloy\nGuitars: Joey Molland and Joe Tansin\nBass: Tom Evans\nDrums: Ken Harck\nSynthesizer: Duane Hitchings\n\n3.&quot;Lost Inside Your Love&quot; Words and music: Tom Evans\nLead vocal: Tom Evans\nHarmonies: Tom Evans, Joe Tansin and Joey Molland\nGuitars: Joey Molland and Joe Tansin\nBass: Tom Evans\nAcoustic piano: Nicky Hopkins\nDrums: Andy Newmark\n\n4.&quot;Love is Gonna Come at Last&quot; Words and music: Joey Molland\nLead vocal: Joey Molland\nHarmonies: Joey Molland, Tom Evans and Joe Tansin\nGuitars: Joey Molland\nPercussion: Steve Foreman\n\n5.&quot;Sympathy&quot; Words and music: Joe Tansin\nLead vocal: Tom Evans\nHarmonies: Joey Molland and Tom Evans\nGuitars: Joey Molland and Joe Tansin\nBass: Tom Evans\nElectric piano: Joey Molland\nPercussion: Steve Foreman\nDrums: Ken Harck\n\n6.&quot;The Winner&quot; Words and music: Joe Tansin\nLead vocal: Joey Molland and Tom Evans\nHarmonies: Joey Molland, Joe Tansin and Tom Evans\nMiddle eight vocal: Joe Tansin and Tom Evans\nLead guitar: Joe Tansin\nBass: Tom Evans\nAcoustic piano and Synthesizer: Duane Hitchings\nDrums: Steve Foreman\n\n7.&quot;The Dreamer&quot; Words and music: Joey Molland\nLead vocal: Joey Molland\nHarmonies: Joey Molland and Tom Evans\nGuitar: Joey Molland and Joe Tansin\nLead guitar: Joe Tansin\nBass: Tom Evans\nPiano and Hammond organ: Nicky Hopkins\nPercussion: Steve Foreman\n\n8.&quot;Come Down Hard&quot; Words and music: Joey Molland\nLead vocal: Joey Molland\nGuitar: Joey Molland and Joe Tansin\nLead guitar: Joe Tansin\nBass: Tom Evans\nDrums: Andy Newmark\n\n9.&quot;Sail Away&quot; Words and music: Tom Evans\nLead vocal and Harmonies: Tom Evans\nAcoustic piano: Nicky Hopkins\nString arrangement: David Campbell\n\n10.&quot;One More Time&quot; Words and music: Joe Tansin\nLead vocal: Joe Tansin\nHarmonies: Joe Tansin and Tom Evans\nGuitars: Joey Molland and Joe Tansin\nLead guitar: Joey Molland\nCardboard box: Ken Harck\nCricket noise: cricket\n\n11.&quot;Send Me Your Love&quot; Words and music: Joe Tansin\nLead vocals, guitar and keys: Joe Tansin\n\n12.&quot;Steal My Heart&quot; Words and music: Joe Tansin\nLead vocal: Joe Tansin\nGuitars and keys: Joe Tansin\nTom Toms: Ken Harck\nSaxophone: Barry Sperti\n\n13.&quot;Love Can't Hide&quot; Words and music: Joey Molland and Joe Tansin\nLead vocal: Joey Molland\nGuitar: Joey Molland\nBass: Tom Lecher\nPiano: Harry Pulver, Jr.\nDrums: Bob Millea\n\n14.&quot;Can You Feel the Rain&quot; Words and music: Joe Tansin\nLead vocal: Joe Tansin\nBacking vocals: Dean Ford and Joe Tansin\nSlide guitar: Rick Salon\nAcoustic guitar: Joe Tansin\nPiano: Scott Greer\nMandolin: Joe Tansin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:157d085649755de7f8e0863070b9b4284184083f","amp;dn":"Badfinger%2FAirwaves+%5B1974%2F2014%5D%5B320KBPS%5D%5BJPNMiniLPSHM-CD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"157d085649755de7f8e0863070b9b4284184083f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,125,8,86,73,117,93,231,248,224,134,48,112,185,180,40,65,132,8,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
