Max Koch also calls in to talk Sopranos, oral sex, kleptomania, movies, and keeping your sack fresh. Ant reads a few submissions from people who would like to take part in the new &quot;unblock promotion,&quot; addresses the myth that he wakes up late, we watch the music video &quot;Call the Cops,&quot; check out an unreal video from a school, and then we are treated to a few more gems from the callers.\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6702c66fc1018d4baf2fb3afcb79e1d1cef6df6","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-09-17+%28MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6702c66fc1018d4baf2fb3afcb79e1d1cef6df6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,112,44,102,252,16,24,212,186,242,251,58,252,183,158,29,28,239,109,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
