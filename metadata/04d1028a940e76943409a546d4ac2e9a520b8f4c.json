At a Top Secret Military base in the ghost town of Morgue, California a small group of Air Force officers and guards is awaiting the landing of the Zanti penal ship. They are informed that the Zanti value their privacy and told to leave the ship alone. The military is prepared to comply until a car with a runaway wife and a three time loser named Ben Garth crashes through the barricades and breaks down in the desert near the Zanti ship.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04d1028a940e76943409a546d4ac2e9a520b8f4c","amp;dn":"The+Outer+Limits+-+The+Zanti+Misfits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04d1028a940e76943409a546d4ac2e9a520b8f4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,209,2,138,148,14,118,148,52,9,165,70,212,172,46,154,82,11,143,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
