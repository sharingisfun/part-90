If you want to test the game mechanics of Conflict-Series, a LITE version of Operation Barbarossa is available for free.\n\nWhat's different in Eastern Front compared to Operation Barbarossa:\n\n+ Scaled up: Larger map, more units, more panzers &amp; Waffen SS, more cities... Now you can finally outmanoeuvre more than just couple of units to form ÃƒÂ¼ber-encirclements.\n\n+ Tactical Areas/MPs: Some hexagons are connected together forming slowly evolving Tactical Areas, and you can move between such hexagons using Tactical MPs instead of regular MPs. This opens up a completely new tactical dimension.\n\n+ Economy &amp; Production: You decide how to use the industrial resources that you capture: Build railway networks, produce Rail MPs, manufacture minefields, fuel, etc.\n\n+ Railway Network: To navigate the huge game area efficiently you need to plan where to build railway network.\n\n+ Generals: Generals support the closest units in battle at the cost of 1 MP, while the front line units located too far away from Generals might lose 1 MP.\n\n+ Removed Spie and stats to reduce memory usage and to streamline the gameplay.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n+ Historical accuracy: Campaign mirrors the historical setup.\n\n+ Long-lasting: Thanks to in-built variation and the game's smart AI technology, each game provides a unique war gaming experience.\n\n+ Competitive: Measure your strategy game skills against others fighting for the Hall of Fame top spots.\n\n+ Experienced units learn new skills, like improved attack or defense performance, extra move points, damage resistance, ability to cross rivers without losing move points, etc.\n\n+ Settings: Various options are available to alter the look of the gaming experience: Switch between terrain themes, change difficulty level, choose icon set for units (NATO or REAL) and cities (Round, Shield, or Square), decide what is drawn on the map, change font and hexagon sizes.\n\n+ Inexpensive: The entire WWII eastern front for the price of a coffee!\n\n\nIn order to be a victorious general, you must learn to coordinate your attacks in two ways. First, as adjacent units give support to an attacking unit, keep your units in groups in order to gain local superiority. Secondly, it is rarely the best idea to use brute force when it is possible to encircle the enemy and cut off its supply lines instead.\n\nWhat's New:\n\nIf you have any suggestions, please use email.
