Earth's defenders never surrender!\n\nPrevious torrents have run into problems of my source files hashing differently and therefore can't be completed. I tried remaking it with some variations in piece size and now my local copy rechecks 100%. So please try this (it uses the same folder as the original but I'd HIGHLY recommend backing up your files from the original torrent just in case). If this works, I'll re-make torrents for the other files.\n\nThese are HQ x264 rips from the Power Rangers Legacy Collection DVDs. The movie Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie is also included, an x264 rip from the latest DVD.\n\n \nTurbo: A Power Rangers Movie is a feature-length movie set in the Power Rangers universe. Directed by sci-fi veteran David Winning and Shuki Levy. It attempted to serve as a bridge between the television series Power Rangers Zeo and Power Rangers Turbo.\n\n \nPower Rangers Turbo (often abbreviated as PRT) was a television show based on the Japanese Super Sentai television series Gekisou Sentai Carranger (translated as Racing Squadron Carranger) featuring the fifth generation of the Power Rangers.\n\nThe series is the followup to Power Rangers Zeo and the continuation of the storyline begun in the film, Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie, in which the former Zeo Rangers Tommy (Zeo V - Red), Adam (Zeo IV - Green), Tanya (Zeo II - Yellow), and Kat (Zeo I - Pink) are joined by Justin, the twelve-year-old new Blue Ranger (who replaces an injured Rocky), in the quest to stop Divatox, a barbaric but beautiful space pirate, from unleashing the evil of her demonic fiancÃƒÂ©, Maligore, upon the universe. The power of the Zeo Crystal and the Zeo Zords are not strong enough to withstand this new evil, so Zordon and Alpha 5 assist the Rangers in creating the new Turbo Powers, which also give the Rangers new Turbo Zords. The show takes place after the movie","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecb351d152a28fb7fce2774fb1dfa6f922ea1a78","amp;dn":"Power+Rangers+Turbo+%28Legacy+Collection+and+Beyond%29+%28fix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecb351d152a28fb7fce2774fb1dfa6f922ea1a78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,179,81,209,82,162,143,183,252,226,119,79,177,223,166,249,34,234,26,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
