(1943) DVD9 - Brian Donlevy, Anna Lee [DDR]\n\nHangmen Also Die! is a 1943 noir war film directed by the Austrian director Fritz Lang and written by John Wexley from a story by Bertolt Brecht and Lang. The film stars Hans Heinrich von Twardowski, Brian Donlevy, Walter Brennan, Alexander Granach and Anna Lee, and features Gene Lockhart and Dennis O'Keefe. The music is by Hanns Eisler and James Wong Howe served as cinematographer.\n\nThe film is loosely based on the 1942 assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the Nazi Reich Protector of German-occupied Prague, number-two man in the SS, and a chief architect of the Holocaust, who was known as &quot;The Hangman of Prague.&quot; The real Heydrich was assassinated by Czech resistance fighters parachuted from a British plane in Operation Anthropoid, but in the movie, which was made during World War II before the full story had become public knowledge, Heydrich's killer is depicted as a member of the Czech resistance with ties to the Communist Party.\n\nHangmen Also Die! was Bertolt Brecht's only script for a Hollywood film: the money he earned from the project enabled him to write The Visions of Simone Machard, Schweik in the Second World War and an adaptation of Webster's The Duchess of Malfi. Hanns Eisler was nominated for an Academy Award for his musical score. The collaboration of three prominent refugees from Nazi GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â€œLang, Brecht and EislerÃ¢â‚¬â€œis an example of the influence this generation of German exiles had in American culture.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Hans Heinrich von Twardowski as Reinhard Heydrich\n    Brian Donlevy as Dr. Franticek Svoboda\n    Walter Brennan as Prof. Stephen Novotny\n    Anna Lee as Mascha Novotny\n    Gene Lockhart as Emil Czaka (brewer)\n    Dennis O'Keefe as Jan Horak (Mascha's fiancÃƒÂ©)\n    Nana Bryant as Mrs. Hellie Novotny\n    Margaret Wycherly as Ludmilla Novotny\n    Tonio Selwart as Chief of Gestapo Kurt Haas\n    Alexander Granach as Gestapo Insp.

(1943)\nDuring the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, surgeon Dr. Franticek Svoboda (Brian Donlevy), a Czech patriot, assassinates the brutal &quot;Hangman of Europe&quot;, Reichsprotektor Reinhard Heydrich (Hans Heinrich von Twardowski), but his getaway car is discovered and therefore his planned safe house must reject him. When a woman he doesn't know, named Mascha (Anna Lee), deliberately misdirects German soldiers close to finding him, he seeks her home as an alternative safe house. This turns out to be the home of her father, history professor Stephen Novotny (Walter Brennan), whom the Nazis have banned from teaching. This plan works. But because the assassin now can't be found, the Nazi leaders in Prague decide to create an incentive for him to turn himself in or for others to do so. They arrangeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwith the help of fifth-columnist Emil Czaka (Gene Lockhart), a wealthy brewerÃ¢â‚¬â€œfor 400 citizens, including Professor Novotny, to be executed, forty at a time, until the assassin is named. Through a complex series of events, however, the resistance manages to frame Czaka himself for the murder, but not before the Nazis have executed many of the hostages.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 5236 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 134 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f12feaa290d47b98a541ad56529c0f914497db36","amp;dn":"Hangmen+Also+Die+%21+%281943%29+DVD9+-++%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f12feaa290d47b98a541ad56529c0f914497db36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,47,234,162,144,212,123,152,165,65,173,86,82,156,15,145,68,151,219,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
