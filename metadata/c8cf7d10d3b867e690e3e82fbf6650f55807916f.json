Here, a taste of Ennio Morricone, Astor Piazzola, French musette and Nino Rota make up what is perhaps his greatest film score to date. At times bizarre, haunting, exhilarating and powerful, the lush sonorities of this dynamic group will surprise you as much as it did Zorn himself. A romantic new lyricism. A remarkable new direction. Unexpected, inevitable and absolutely essential. \n\nPersonnel:\nRob Burger: Accordion\nTrevor Dunn: Bass\nErik Friedlander: Cello\nMarc Ribot: Guitar\nKenny Wollesen: Vibraphone, Marimba, Drums\n\n\n    &quot;Invitation To A Suicide&quot; - 4:38\n    &quot;Suicide Waltz&quot; - 4:21\n    &quot;Shifting Sands&quot; - 4:12\n    &quot;East Greenpoint Rundown&quot; - 4:08\n    &quot;Time Twist&quot; - 3:39\n    &quot;The Suicide Kid&quot; - 4:08\n    &quot;Billet Doux&quot; - 1:43\n    &quot;Suicide Blues Part 1&quot; - 4:15\n    &quot;Trance Dance&quot; - 3:13\n    &quot;Lonely Are The Dumb&quot; - 2:45\n    &quot;Moon Moods&quot; - 1:58\n    &quot;Bugsy's Jazztet&quot; - 2:12\n    &quot;Suicide Blues Part 2&quot; - 3:44\n    &quot;Roary's Waltz&quot; - 2:56\n    &quot;Getting Suicidal&quot; - 1:39\n    &quot;Final Retribution&quot; - 2:50\n    &quot;Aftermath&quot; - 3:09\n    &quot;Unjust Reward&quot; - 1:36\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8cf7d10d3b867e690e3e82fbf6650f55807916f","amp;dn":"John+Zorn+-+Filmworks+13+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8cf7d10d3b867e690e3e82fbf6650f55807916f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,207,125,16,211,184,103,230,144,227,232,47,191,102,80,245,88,7,145,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
