The album is a really mish-mash of styles, from Industrial to Techno to Blues to Indie Pop to Death Metal to Hip-Hop and Trance. It features clean symphonically sung vocals, harsh screams, strange vocal utterances, and more modern approaches to singing, as well a hodgepodge of synthesizers, guitars, drums, samples, and effects mishmash all done under the guise of one godMan: theProphet himself. There is little that this album doesn't offers, except for maybe hope.\n\nThis is one of the most bleak and depressing albums one will listen to, truly bringing you through a journey across the post-apocalyptic landscapes rittled with disease, infection, and decay. The undead have destroyed our once utopian paradise in the year 2137 after a nasty alien parasite nearly wiped out most of the planet reducing them to pseudo-zombie-esk alien-human hybrid monsters. Only a few survivors roam the planet, banded together in search for The Final Solution.\n\nWelcome to a world covered in ash, where only the Qliphoth reigns supreme.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ec15c48828c523f3d7f78cf64bc1d668ca685e3","amp;dn":"Jenova+Project+-+Z+Day+%5B320kpbs+%2F+Industrial+%2F+Electronica+%2F+Exp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ec15c48828c523f3d7f78cf64bc1d668ca685e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,193,92,72,130,140,82,63,61,127,120,207,100,188,29,102,140,166,133,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
