While attempting to access accomodation, they are repeatedly told that rooms will only be rented to married couples, not to bachelors. Frustrated at this, two of them disguise themselves as women, and pose as wives for the other two males. They are able to secure accomodation with the Mishra family. Complications arise when the two &quot;women&quot; fall in love with Mishra's two lovely daughters - with results that can only be described as hilarious. \n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1049 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 352x272\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.294:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 224kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: Hindi\nRunTime: 2:07:04\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c7a0dfc43b1dfe8bd93ae202000bb26d880312c","amp;dn":"Biwi+Aur+Makan+%281963%29+Xvid+1.0g+-+No+Subs+-+Biswajeet%2C+Kalpana%2C+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c7a0dfc43b1dfe8bd93ae202000bb26d880312c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,122,13,252,67,177,223,232,189,147,174,32,32,0,187,38,216,128,49,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
