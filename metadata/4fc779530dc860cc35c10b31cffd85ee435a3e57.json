Eight\nbeautiful tracks selected with love and passion by\nEphedra and Kuririn! This compilation will take you\non a journey from the acidic sounds of nighttime\nGoatrance to the melodic and trancy vibes for the\nshiny mornings.\n\nIt all starts with the French newcomer Proxeeus, who\nwill kick you back in time with some acidic oldskool\nsounds (remember the golden 90's?). Next, M-run\ndelivers his typical groovy beats and psycho sounds\nof which he alone knows the secret and Nova Fractal\nwill smash you into space with his stellar remix of\nArtifact303: 'In your mind'. The compilation then\nevolves with a very bouncy track from the Swedish\nmaster Trinodia followed by Goatree who brings a very\nmelodic and acidic track with a Psytrance edge.\n\nEphedra and Imba strike back with a pure morning\ntrack coming from the deep cosmos while JIS brings\nyou a very melodic and trancey piece of art. The\ncompilation ends with a sublime downtempo track from\nthe French producer Crossing Mind! Just listen and\nlet yourself float between the moon and the sun.\n\n          We would like to take the\n        opportunity to point out that psytrance\n       needs YOUR SUPPORT. We only want to\n     give you a preview in psytrance,\n  ambient and electronic music and\n in our opinion this is absolutely\nNO alternative to buying.\n\n MP3 isnt the same as holding a\nbought record in your hands !!\n\nYou need to feel the bass to go with the\nflow ... and that's what mp3 just can't\ngive you. So better get it in high\nquality, while it's still available\nand not soldout.\n\n  Please support the artists and\n  especially smaller labels that make\n it possible to enjoy the music you\nseem to love that much!\n\nOur releases are for scene internal use so\nKEEP THEM OFF P2P AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES!!\n\nSo much for now\nmeet ya @ the next party ... somewhere.\n\nMYCEL - sending lamers to /dev/null since 2003\n\nWe bow our heads to our old friends.\n\nDeep respect to you!\n\nAlso we would like to greet all of the\n\nstill alive quality scenegroups/sceners!\n\nwant to be part of the mycelenium?\n\nAscii done with love to my lil d3vil.\n          - Creature of Hell\n\n[last update: 2007-05-24]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fc779530dc860cc35c10b31cffd85ee435a3e57","amp;dn":"VA_-_Floating_Between_The_Moon_And_The_Sun-Compiled_By_Ephedra_A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fc779530dc860cc35c10b31cffd85ee435a3e57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,199,121,83,13,200,96,204,53,193,11,49,207,253,133,238,67,90,62,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
