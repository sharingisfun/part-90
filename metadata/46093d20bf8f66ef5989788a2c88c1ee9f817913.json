Without going all Adele with self-referential numbers, his first EP proper contains 'Savage', 'Eden' and the more recent 'Youth'.\n\nThere's also debut 'Drive (Part 1)', which premiered on DIY back in 2013. Since then Ben's been compared to Jai Paul by every publication under the sun, while successfully managing to release more tracks than Jai's entire career in the space of less than 12 months. Without overstating anything, this is one of the essential EPs of the year so far; a drastic shift in electronic pop with both eyes set on the future.\n\n'1992' is out 5th May via Blessed Vice.\n\n\n[b]01.[/b] Youth (3:17)\n[b]02.[/b] Savage (2:35)\n[b]03.[/b] Eden (2:37)\n[b]04.[/b] Drive, Pt. 1 (3:26)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46093d20bf8f66ef5989788a2c88c1ee9f817913","amp;dn":"Ben+Khan+-+1992+%282014%29+-+V0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46093d20bf8f66ef5989788a2c88c1ee9f817913","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,9,61,32,191,143,102,239,89,137,120,138,44,136,193,238,159,129,121,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
