Based on the play originally titled The Terror (New York, 9 Feb 1931) by Howard W. Comstock and Allen C. Miller. It was directed by Michael Curtiz and stars Lee Tracy, Fay Wray, and Lionel Atwill.\n\nThe film was produced before the Motion Picture Production Code was enforced. Themes such as murder, rape, cannibalism and prostitution are interwoven into the story. \n\nDoctor X is a mystery-horror film with tongue-in-cheek comedic elements. It is considered by some to be of the &quot;old dark house&quot; genre of horror films, and takes place in 1932 New York City and Long Island, New York.\n\nReporter Lee Taylor (Lee Tracy) is investigating a series of pathological murders that have taken place over a series of months in New York City. The murders always take place at night, under the light of a full moon (the newspapers dubbing them the &quot;Moon Killer Murders&quot;). Furthermore, each body has been cannibalized after the murder has taken place. Witnesses to the events describe a horribly disfigured &quot;monster&quot; as the killer.\n\n\n\nRunning time: 76 minutes\nVideo: avi 720x544 23fps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa588e5f2c3d33d19afd59b4d3bc305edc41a9ab","amp;dn":"Doctor+X+%281932%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa588e5f2c3d33d19afd59b4d3bc305edc41a9ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,88,142,95,44,61,51,209,154,253,89,180,211,188,48,94,220,65,169,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
