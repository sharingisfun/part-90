Countless international reviewers and even their own press biographies have bandied around the term with no genuine fear of contradiction.\n\nTen albums into a career that began in LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leafy suburbs back in 1989, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time this situation was reassessed. Sure, heavy metal and progressive rock are the cornerstones of the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound, but as proven by the consummate quality of their last several albums, Threshold are a classic hard rock band, built upon high-quality musicianship, enormous quantities of musical light and shade and, above all, memorable, hummable songs.\n\nFew bands are capable of gracing the stage of a leather Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ studs gathering such as Bloodstock, as Threshold did in 2004, or conversely the hard rock all-dayer the Firefest, at which they played three years later. Their music is eloquent and deeply melodic without relying upon the usual gratuitous levels of power and repetitive twiddly bits.\n\n&quot;The key to Threshold is songs,&quot; believes long-serving keyboard player Richard West. &quot;By all means we have all those extra ingredients, but without the song youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve nothing.&quot;\n\n&quot;IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve no objection to the label,&quot; elaborates Damian Wilson, among the finest singers of the current hard rock scene, &quot;it only bothers me when causing people, who might otherwise enjoy us, to shut themselves off. Nobody likes being pigeonholed.&quot;\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœFor The JourneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the sextetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s third studio release for Nuclear Blast Records, following in the slipstream of Ã¢â‚¬ËœDead ReckoningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (2007) and Ã¢â‚¬ËœMarch Of ProgressÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (2012Ã¢â‚¬â„¢). The latter album saw the return of Wilson, the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vocalist from 1992-1993 and 1996-1998, after the departure (and subsequent tragic demise) of Andrew Ã¢â‚¬ËœMacÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ McDermott. Over this trilogy of records, a thread of consistency and confidence has allowed Threshold to excel whilst treading their chosen path.\n\nTracklist:\n1. Watchtower on the Moon\n2. Unforgiven\n3.
