His sideman credits include stints with the Mingus Dynasty Band, the Maria Schneider Orchestra, and the Toshiko Akiyoshi Orchestra as well as smaller groups led by Marvin &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith, George Coleman, James Williams, Goeff Keezer, and T. S. Monk among others.\n\nMobley began his career in Memphis, Tennessee performing with fellow Memphis University students Mulgrew Miller, Donald Brown and James Williams. All three of these pianists would later go on to become world-renowned performers in their own right, each developing his own brand of a uniquely Memphis-rooted piano style that fused blues and gospel music with the modern harmonic concepts of McCoy Tyner and Herbie Hancock. It was during this formative period in Memphis that Mobley developed his own distinct harmonic approach to improvising on the trumpet. While somewhat reminiscent of trumpeters Booker Little (a fellow Memphis native) and Woody Shaw, MobleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s style is clearly his own. Incorporating long sinewy lines followed by unexpected harmonic leaps, MobleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trumpet solos stand out boldly from those of his peers.\n\nThe Bill Mobley Jazz Orchestra celebrates the beginning of the third year of Monday night residence at the acclaimed NYC jazz club Smoke. In addition to being an exceptional trumpet player, Bill Mobley lends his musical genius to his wonderful compositions and arrangements.This stellar band has a new release out on Smoke Records that is getting great reviews and a lot of airplay. \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD1\n01.
