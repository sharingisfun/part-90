Yes, it still feels like the game was conceived as one entity before being lopped into pieces, but it successfully manages to maintain a firm sense of intrigue by cultivating a compelling plotline filled with twists and turns, and most importantly, leaves you wanting more at the climax of each episode. Still, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be interesting at this point to see how the whole thing plays out as one overall package come the physical release later this month.\n\nJudgment is an emphatic change of pace, especially for Claire and Moira. Whereas last episode the duo were largely lumbered with legions of foes to slaughter and little else, Capcom has really improved things for Miss Redfield and her brash companion for this latest outing. Much of the action takes place in an industrial complex, which combines frantic shootouts with some of the best puzzles Revelations 2 has seen thus far. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s far more emphasis placed on exploring the environment and soaking up the plot, methodically dispatching creatures that pop up while attempting to access locked-down areas of the facility.\n\nIn typical Resi fashion, this is done by solving obtuse puzzles, which makes a welcome break from the focus action-oriented antics in ClaireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous episode. Again, teamwork comes into play here, not just in terms of combat, but also for solving puzzles, making for a satisfying gameplay dynamic that proves Resi can work effectively as a co-op game while maintaining a degree of tension. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also some brilliant boss encounters and some particularly challenging firefights as you struggle to eliminate groups of powerful enemies with your limited ammunition. The final boss is definitely a highlight and one of the better design enemies in the game. Sadly, if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re playing solo, MoiraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s AI is practically useless, leading to some frustrating sections as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trying to take down the mutated, muscle-bound freak.\n\n* enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6e270fb97b2ac677078f7f705c3077e82a3d365","amp;dn":"RE+Revelations+2+Episode+3+DLC+-+3-2-Play","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6e270fb97b2ac677078f7f705c3077e82a3d365","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,226,112,251,151,178,172,103,112,120,247,247,5,195,7,126,130,163,211,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
