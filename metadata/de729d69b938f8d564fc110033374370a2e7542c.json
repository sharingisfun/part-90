Call of DutyÃ‚Â®: Advanced Warfare envisions a powerful future, where both technology and tactics have evolved to usher in a new era of combat for the franchise. Delivering a stunning performance, Academy AwardÃ‚Â® winning actor Kevin Spacey stars as Jonathan Irons Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one of the most powerful men in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ shaping this chilling vision of the future of war.\n\nAll digital purchases of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare include the bonus Digital Edition Personalization Pack with a custom weapon camo, reticle set and playercard.\n\nPower Changes Everything.\n\nFEATURES\n\nAn Advanced World:\n\nCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare takes place in a plausible future in which technological progress and todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military practices have converged with powerful consequences.\nIn this carefully researched and crafted vision, Private Military Corporations (PMCs) have become the dominant armed forces for countless nations outsourcing their military needs, redrawing borders and rewriting the rules of war.\nAnd Jonathan Irons, the founder and president of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest PMC Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Atlas Corporation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is at the center of it all.\n\nAn Advanced Soldier:\n\nPowerful exoskeletons evolve every aspect of a soldierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s battle readiness, enabling combatants to deploy with an advanced lethality and eliminating the need for specialization.\nThe introduction of this gameplay mechanic delivers enhanced player movement and verticality through boost jumps and grappling, covert cloaking abilities, and biomechanics that provide unparalleled strength, awareness, endurance, and speed.\nWith the advent of the exoskeleton and newly advanced armor and weaponry, every soldier commands tactical freedom in any terrain unlike ever before, fundamentally changing the way gamers play Call of Duty across all modes.\n\nAn Advanced Arsenal:\n\nHarnessing the power of next-gen platforms, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare introduces a new hi-tech, advanced arsenal and ability set, arming players with all-new equipment, technology, perks, and vehicles like hoverbikes and highly specialized drones.\nPlayers can also choose between standard ammunition and an all-new class of directed-energy weaponry that enables totally new gameplay dynamics.\nAnd with exoskeletons delivering a massive force multiplier and unprecedented tactical freedom, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare evolves every firefight.\n\nTitle: Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare\nGenre: Action\nDeveloper: Sledgehammer Games , Raven
