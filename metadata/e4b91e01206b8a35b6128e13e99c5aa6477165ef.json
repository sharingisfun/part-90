Give it a listen.\n\n- Big Papi[/i]\n\n[quote]By Jim Bagley\n\nIf you like your country music on the honky-tonkin' light side, you can't go wrong with Neal McCoy. Hits like &quot;Wink,&quot; &quot;You Gotta Love That,&quot; and &quot;The Shake&quot; (the only new track included ) may border on novelty, but they sure are fun. McCoy's Greatest Hits also presents some top-notch ballads with &quot;No Doubt About It&quot; and a remake of the Casinos &quot;Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye.&quot; He even manages to stray from the festive and/or romantic mold with a nice slice of acidity titled &quot;If I Was A Drinkin' Man.&quot;\n\nUnlike most major label country artists who have emerged over the past decade, it took three albums before McCoy got his first big hit with &quot;No Doubt About It&quot; in late 1993. He only released a couple of albums since then, and with a few tracks included here that didn't make it near the country top ten, it would appear this Greatest Hits collection was a little premature. \n\nIt certainly is skimpier than other recent country sets, at ten tracks totalling 33 minutes in length (this was the unfortunate standard in country music just a couple of years ago). Ultimately, like a lot of McCoy's music, this set is fine - just not substantial.[/quote]\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Neal McCoy - Greatest Hits\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Neal McCoy\nAlbum................: Greatest Hits\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1997\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 270kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
