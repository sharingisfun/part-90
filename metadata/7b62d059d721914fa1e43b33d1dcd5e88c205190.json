This case with contradictory facts was too complex for Policeman Garcia to solve, so he decided to hire the only duo in town capable of solving it: Detective Case and Clown Bot.\nMurder in the Hotel Lisbon is a video game inspired by the classic point and click adventures from the 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s and 90Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s. It adopts these eras distinctive design and it is built using only the pixel art technique. The game itself runs at a native resolution of 256x192, the same resolution used by the old ZX Spectrum 48k and most recently by the Nintendo DS.\nMurder in the Hotel Lisbon may be low res and retro on the visual side, but we made sure that on the audio side your ears would rejoice with a complete original soundtrack. Composed of an orchestral band, a jazz band and a typical Portuguese Fado trio, the musical landscape contrasts beautifully with the colorful graphics. Throughout the game you will hear over 20 different tracks of orchestral music composed and recorded specifically for the game. All these tracks were recorded on studio with a 10-member band composed of friends and colleagues. All of them brought their soul and heart to these recordings and the results are absolutely AWESOME!&quot;\n\nv1.03 changelog:\n- We corrected all the typos and grammatical errors people found AND told us about.
