New leader Mel is working harder than ever and is\nworried she will be the next one to crack, and the situation gets worse overnight\nwhen rain and a sudden drop in temperature leaves the ground frozen, forcing the\ntribe members to rely on their rations. To commemorate their time living in Stone\nAge conditions, they create a cave painting using dyes made from sloe berries and\ncharcoal.
