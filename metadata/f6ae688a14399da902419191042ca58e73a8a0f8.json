Suitable for those who have completed the standard calculus sequence, the book assumes no prior knowledge of differential equations. It explains the exact solution of only the simplest differential equations, such as first-order linear and separable equations.\n\nWith varying levels of problems in each section, this self-contained text makes the difficult subject of asymptotics easy to comprehend. Along the way, it explores the properties of some important functions in applied mathematics. Although the book emphasizes problem solving, some proofs are scattered throughout to give readers a justification for the methods used.\n\nProduct Details:\nPDF: 550 pages\nPublisher: Chapman and Hall/CRC; 1 edition (July 18, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1466515112\nISBN-13: 978-1466515116\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6ae688a14399da902419191042ca58e73a8a0f8","amp;dn":"Asymptotic+Analysis+and+Perturbation+Theory+%282013%29+%5BHxH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6ae688a14399da902419191042ca58e73a8a0f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,174,104,138,20,57,157,169,2,65,145,145,4,44,165,142,115,168,160,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
