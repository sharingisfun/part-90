Reed, including Leonard E. Read's classic essay, &quot;I, Pencil&quot;. Reed's book establishes the indispensable connection between liberty and character and explains why, throughout history, &quot;no people who lost their character kept their liberty.&quot; It is a book of stories and lessons from the past and from across the world. It instructs as well, noting that &quot;If you do not govern yourself, you will be governed.&quot;\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n Lawrence W.
