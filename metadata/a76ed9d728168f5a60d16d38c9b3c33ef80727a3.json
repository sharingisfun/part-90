What can Nietzsche have in common with this murderous ideology? Frequently described as the &quot;radical aristocrat&quot; of the spirit, Nietzsche abhorred mass culture and strove to cultivate an ÃƒÅ“bermensch endowed with exceptional mental qualities. What can such a thinker have in common with the fascistic manipulation of the masses for chauvinistic goals that crushed the autonomy of the individual?\n\nThe question that lies at the heart of this collection is how Nietzsche came to acquire the deadly &quot;honor&quot; of being considered the philosopher of the Third Reich and whether such claims had any justification. Does it make any sense to hold him in some way responsible for the horrors of Auschwitz?\n\nThe editors present a range of views that attempt to do justice to the ambiguity and richness of Nietzsche's thought. First-rate contributions by a variety of distinguished philosophers and historians explore in depth Nietzsche's attitudes toward Jews, Judaism, Christianity, anti-Semitism, and National Socialism. They interrogate Nietzsche's writings for fascist and anti-Semitic proclivities and consider how they were read by fascists who claimed Nietzsche as their intellectual godfather.\n\nThere is much that is disturbingly antiegalitarian and antidemocratic in Nietzsche, and his writings on Jews are open to differing interpretations. Yet his emphasis on individualism and contempt for German nationalism and anti-Semitism put him at stark odds with Nazi ideology.\n\nThe Nietzsche that emerges here is a tragic prophet of the spiritual vacuum that produced the twentieth century's totalitarian movements, the thinker who best diagnosed the pathologies of fin-de-siÃƒÂ¨cle European culture. Nietzsche dared to look into the abyss of modern nihilism. This book tells us what he found.\n\nThe contributors are Menahem Brinker, Daniel W.
