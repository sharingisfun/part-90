'Audio One', a new large group, fronted (and a new 9 track book\ncomposed) by Vandermark, are planning an April release. I guess it was time to\ncatch up on his other large ensemble and revisit 'Head Above Water/ Feet Out of\nthe Fire', the late 2013 release from his international Resonance Ensemble on\nNot Two Records.\n\nThe album begins by tipping the hat to 70's powerhouse improv group 'Creative\nConstruction Company' and in particular Muhal Richard Abrams with Creative\nReconstruction Company. It starts out sounding like a pack of rabid dogs on\nleashes of varying sizes. You never know if they will pull taught at arms\nlength or mere inches from your jugular. This is the power of the Vandermark\ncomposition at its finest. He is there, guiding them though the workout of\nnotes on the page, with whistle in mouth just in case. It builds and recedes\nand lets the smaller dogs sing before the next wave of growling envelops your\nears layered over a pretty addictive drum and bass groove.\n\nThere is something to be said for the sequence of tracks on a recording. Only\nseconds after the opening kick to the embouchure, comes Elegy for Two Rooms\n(For Fred Anderson and Von Freeman). It is like watching a tear from in the\ncorner of someone's eye and over the course of 10 minutes, you study intently\nas it rolls down the face leaving a trail of itself, and distant pleasant\nmemories, until it slows down over the cheek bone and pauses on the chin before\nslightly darkening the fabric of the shirt it gets absorbed into. Listen.\n\nThe first CD ends with Type A (For Michael Orlove). This 21 minute monster has\nenough in it to almost warrant its own release. It is demanding and complex,\ncompelling and exhausting. Vandermark begins with a mini overture which\ndisassembles itself over and over again all held together with Devin Hoff's\nelectric bass. By the time it finishes, all you want to do is take a break and\nfully contemplate what just happened, but no, there is another CD waiting....\n\nWithout going into too much detail, the second disc is full of Vandermarkisms\nwith include sheets of brass coming at you like ninjas in a cymbal factory to\nbreakdowns where quartets, trios, duos, and solos are highlighted and even\nrevered. However there is a sense of finality to this recording as if all that\ncan be said has been said. I do hope I'm wrong.\n\n--\n\nBy Mark Corroto &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/head-above-water-feet-out-of-the-fire-ken-vandermark-resonance-ensemble-not-two-records-review-by-mark-corroto.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/head-above-water-feet-out-of-the-fire-ken-vandermark-resonance-ensemble-not-two-records-review-by-mark-corroto.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Bird is the Worm &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.birdistheworm.com/the-resonance-ensemble-head-above-water-feet-out-of-the-fire/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.birdistheworm.com/the-resonance-ensemble-head-above-water-feet-out-of-the-fire/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d9cd48fd80e088aa396c8011b4552fb14a7bef7","amp;dn":"The+Resonance+Ensemble+-+Head+Above+Water%2C+Feet+Out+Of+The+Fire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d9cd48fd80e088aa396c8011b4552fb14a7bef7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,156,212,143,216,14,8,138,163,150,200,1,27,69,82,251,20,167,190,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
