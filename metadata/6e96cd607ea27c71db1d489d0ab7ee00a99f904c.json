He thought wrong. The leprechaun followed him and O'Grady barely gets away with his life, having locked the little monster in his basement. Ten years later, J.D. and his spoiled daughter Tory move in. By accident, the leprechaun is released and almost immediately the annoying creature starts to look for his gold, not displaying any respect for human life.\n\nDirectors\n\n- Mark Jones \n\nCast\n\n- Warwick Davis as Leprechaun \n- Jennifer Aniston as Tory Reding \n- Ken Olandt as Nathan Murphy \n- Mark Holton as Ozzie","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e96cd607ea27c71db1d489d0ab7ee00a99f904c","amp;dn":"Leprechaun+%281993%29+1080p+1.4Gb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e96cd607ea27c71db1d489d0ab7ee00a99f904c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,150,205,96,126,162,124,113,219,29,72,157,10,183,238,0,169,159,144,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
